         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172208:3"/>N. it needs muſt be great comfort to me, when I conſider that you are to partake a more then ord nary share in the good diuidend of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bleſsings, for the benefitt which vertuous ſoules may receiue by theſe Rules: you who already haue ſo happily made him the owner of your heart, by the Character of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſufferings for his ſake: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in vertuous courage, and true fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, you haue not only imitated your noble Anceſters, but farr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the preſident which they haue left you: for as our Chronicles doe truly aſcribe to them, an vnaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſtancy in defence of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full earthly Soueraignes right: ſo you, now the laſt in your Sex of that ſelf fame noble Family, not degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, doe generouſly conclude your part after a much more honorable manner, by cheerefull and conſtant ſufferance for your true heauenly King, our Soueraigne Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <hi>IESVS-CHRIST:</hi> from
<pb facs="tcp:172208:4"/>whom, with the great Apoſtle, you may in humble hope expect, that <hi>theſe momentary tribulations will worke aboue meaſure exceedingly an eternall weight of glory. 2. Cor. 4.</hi> Your ioy in this hope, may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gett vertuous Patience in theſe your preſent ſufferings; which will beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me light and eaſie, by his diuine loue, who beſt can giue ſtrength to beare them for his ſacke. This holy loue is that which gaue ſuch inuincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to all the bleſſed Martyrs of each ſex and age; as alſo to the tender and moſt illuſtrious Virgins, ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantedly to ſuffer the greateſt rage &amp; torments which their cruell perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors could inuent to exerciſe vpon thoſe innocent and happy victimes of <hi>IESVS-CHRIST.</hi> This is that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly eloquence which now perſwades ſo many millions of verious and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſoules to forſake all the alluring pleaſures, which this deluding world is able to propoſe vnto its greateſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorits; and to embrace the austerity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172208:4"/>of a religious life: that dying thereby to all worldly pretentions, they may truly, and entirely liue to God. This diuine loue is finally that which hath replenished the deſerts with verie Angels in purity, though inueſted with humaine bodies in their mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Yea in the propbaneſt Courts, and in all ſortes of ſecular callings, what multitudes of moſt holy and vertuous perſons hath this odoriferous oyntment ſtill drawne to true ſanctity, in the obſeruance of a moſt exemplar life, and vertuous Conuerſation.

This giues me the greateſt confidence that my paines herein will be gratefull vnto you: and ſo much the more ſatisfactory alſo to my ſelfe; as your vertuous example shall giue good proofe, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in theſe Chriſtian Rules, which may not eaſily be practized by a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſoule, aſpiring to holy perfection, with faithfull correſpondance to Gods holy grace, in the true practiſe of his loue.</p>

               </head>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:172208:11"/>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>WO things are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally neceſſary to the workman for makeing a true, and perfect buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to witt: his eye, for the choyce of materials; &amp; the Rule or ſquare, whereby to lay them in iuſt proportion, and with right order in the worke. Now Purity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is the eye, whereby direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our actions to the glory of God, they become meritorious, &amp; true materials towards the happy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:172208:12"/>building of our Saluation: and Gods diuine Preſence ſerues vs as the Rule, and Square, whereby to keepe them right with the will of God; whome behoulding, we shall feare to offend, and thereby adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that happy building in our Soules. Wherefore, to vſe the methode moſt conducing to theſe Rules; I here propoſe theſe two important Exerciſes before the reſt: becauſe the good, or ill of all our actions depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding therevpon; it will be firſt fitt to ſee, both wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, as alſo how to practiſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a maine point in Chriſtianity, to know that the Intention giues to all our actions their true valew in the ſight of God: for as to giue Almes for his ſake, is a vertue deſeruing eternall recompence; ſo likewiſe to giue the ſame for vanity, and worldly praiſe, is a ſinne much blamed in the Goſpel by IESVS-CHR. as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the faſt of Hypocrits, who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172208:12"/>faſt, &amp; praye to gaine eſteeme and honour in the ſight of men. <hi>Mat</hi> 6. True Purity therefore of Intention is to all our actions, as ſalt is to meate, and as our verie ſoule to the body: for without it no action can auaile vs towards Heauen. It is as the Kings ſtamp to the coyne, from whence the true valew is tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; or as his ſeale, which giues to the Patent all it's power and force. For as a right Intention renders our giuing a cup of cold water me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious of life euerlaſting; euen ſo the moſt glorious Act we can doe, will nothing auaile our ſoules without it. By this Purity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention all our actions muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated for their ſpirituall perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And to hitt right vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py marke, we firſt muſt leuell (as doth the Archer) by a little pauſe, to take ayme in the beginning of all we doe, to direct it to the glory of God: &amp; as he alſo winkes with his left eye, to hinder the diſſipatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:172208:13"/>of his ſight, and aymes only with the right: ſo Chriſtian Perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that we shutting our harts to all ſiniſter &amp; vaine reſpects, should place our whole vewe, &amp; attention vpon the honour of God, &amp; for the accomplishment of his holy will; for what is not refer'd therevnto, is but loſt, and in vaine: whereas the leaſt thought or deed, accompanied with that holy motiue, <hi>for the loue of God,</hi> will haue no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paradiſe for it's reward; <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with what care and diligence ought we to practiſe this fruitfull Exerciſe, and to make it our firſt morning act, thereby to conſecrate all our thoughts, words, and deeds of that day for the glory of God; to the end that if vaine glory, or anie other ill ſuggeſtion shall preſent it ſelfe, we may more eaſily repell them, as comming too late, and after ſo much better an owner hath taken his poſſeſſion therein.</p>
               <p>This generall, &amp; habituall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:172208:13"/>in our morning practiſe, muſt be gently ſeconded by frequent like acts in the beginning of all our chiefe actions in the day; by briefly offering them to God, and humbly crauing that we no wayfe offende him thereby. For all which a ſmall tyme may ſuffice; either by eleuation of the hart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; or by deuout eiaculations, ſaying: <hi>for thy ſake, ô Lord, it is that I doe this. That I make this viſit. That I eate. That I pray. That I ſuffer, or doe this action;</hi> and the like. And as it was the primitiue cuſtome, ſo ſtill it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues amongſt vertuous people, to begin their actions with the ſigne of the Croſſe, thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the purity of their intention, in doing them, as S. Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands vs, <hi>for the glory of God.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>This purely muſt be the motiue, and finall end of whatſoeuer we doe; and as it was the ſpirituall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:172208:14"/>food of our Soueraigne Lord IESVS <hi>to doe the will of his heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Iohn.</hi> 4. So is it to be the firſt courſe for the feaſt of a vertuous ſoule, and likewiſe the middle ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and the laſt, whereon to feed.</p>
               <p>This Pure Intention for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God (by doing his heauenly will) is the marke at which both Prince, and Prelate; both rich and poore, we all muſt ayme at it: yea all our employments, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for gaines, or pleaſure; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a ſecular, or in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſtate of life; be it Preacher ſtudent, or Maiſter; be it Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in peace, or be it Souldier, for whatſoeuer he is to execute in warr; all muſt be regulated with this vnerring Rule of a Pure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to pleaſe God, by doing his bleſſed will. This holy ſauce giues a pleaſing relish to the moſt diſtaiſtfull bitts, which either Chriſtians, or religious Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation can preſent to our recoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:172208:14"/>nature; this powerfull, and diuine ingredience <hi>(the loue of God)</hi> ſo ſweeten's all; as I dare in confident humility here promiſe, in Gods behalfe; that no Lay-Brother, or Siſter in their moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious employments; nor yet thoſe of the Quire, by anie more painfull and Spirituall labours; nor finally anie other, of what calling, or condition ſoeuer, who shall but be faithfull in this holy Exerciſe, will euer perish vnder the oppreſſion of ſo bleſſed, and happy a burden, which diuine Treuth himſelfe hath ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promiſſed to make both ſweet, and light to all ſuch, as by auoyding ſinne, shall comply with his heauenly will. This is the vnerring Square, and certaine Rule whereby to regulate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we doe: vnto which, the meaneſt action, which shall be found anſwerable, will be of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable valew; and what correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:172208:15"/>not to this bleſſed Rule, is but corruption of nature, and filth for the ſinke of Hell.</p>
               <p>By all this, it now ſufficiently appeares, of what importance it is to prefix a Pure Intention to whatſoeuer we doe; that being the forme, the ſoule, and verie eſſence which giues both life and valew therevnto: for according to our intention, it will be eſteemed, either good, or bad in the ſight of God, how deceitfully ſoeuer it may appeare to the eyes of Men. As truly the guift of a cupp of cold water may well ſeeme but a very ſmall matter to vs; which yet being giuen with a true motiue of Charity, it will be eternally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in Heauen; whereas the lofty Phareſies, who caſt whole handfulls of money with vanity into the trunk of the Temple, was nothing (in the eſteeme of IFSVS-CHRIST himſelfe) in compariſon of the poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:172208:15"/>two farthings, which shee gaue with a Pure Intention for the honour of God. Yea moſt euident it is, that the Act which we shall doe in grace, and by the pure motiue of Charity; farr ſurpaſſeth what either art, witt, or ſcience are able to produce; and is farr to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before anie other act; yea though the conuerſion of whole Nations, and the eternall Bliſſe, both of Angells, and Men should depend therevpon: for all that, in reſpect of what concernes the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, belongs to an infinitly inferior order, and can admit no degree of compariſon: no the only ſacred name of IESVS religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced by the Iuſt, and in the holy Ghoſt; excells beyond all proportion, the valew of the heigheſt excellency within the bounds of all created nature.</p>
               <p>Wherefore conſidering now, as well the great profit; as alſo the preciſe neceſſity of prefixing this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:172208:16"/>holy Intention both to our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to whatſoeuer we doe; let vs frequently in the day, and at the beginning of all our chiefe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, renew our morning oblation thereof; and directing our hart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; let vs renounce our owne proper ſatisfaction, and will, to vnite it to God's; crauing humbly his diuine grace, that we neuer doe anie thing contrary therevnto.</p>
               <p>In fine, all our thoughts, words and deeds muſt be offered vnto God, in vnion, honour, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and in the ſpirit, Intention, and diſpoſition of all the ſacred actions of IESVS-CHRIST; in whoſe regard they will be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and admitted in expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Take ſpeciall great heed that no corrupt Intention blaſt that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fruit of your actions; and be verie wary of the ſubtile poiſon of vaine-glory, ſelfe-loue, &amp; priuate ſatisfaction, which is the ruine &amp;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:172208:16"/>deſtruction of all ſpirituall profitt in the ſoule. Regard not the ſight, nor cenſure of anie Man; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that only of God; who both rewards and punishes, not only in this world, but alſo eternally in the other. Recall with true ſorrow the many loſt actions of your life paſt, for want of true Purity of Intention; and direct them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in vnion of that diuine Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour IESVS-CHRIST, did honour his heauenly Father in all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, during the whole courſe both of his life, and death: for he being our Originall Prototype, &amp; diuine Model; we ought thereby to frame aur actions, and to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them the beſt we can.</p>
               <p>Examine now well by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, how farr you haue been faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for what is paſt; and with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty repentance, propoſe (by God's grace) to be more carefull for the tyme to come: and endeauoring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:172208:17"/>by manie feruent aſpirations, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to offer vp all your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God; craue humbly his heauenly help, that they may be both begunn, &amp; ended to his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory: and that you may be ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtruck by death it ſelfe; then conſent deliberately to offend his Maieſty, by anie grieuous ſinne.</p>

               <head>THE SECOND PARTE <hi>Of this Rule; shewing that the memory of Gods diuine Preſence is a maine incitement to vertue; and a great curb to all Vice.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>PYrity of Intention can nowaiſe be better ſeconded, then by the help of this enſuing part; of <hi>Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Preſence:</hi> for who well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that he is the beholder of whatſoeuer we doe; as it muſt needs, on the one ſide encourage, &amp; exceedingly excite him to direct all his actions to the glory of him,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:172208:17"/>who is ſo bountifull a rewarder; ſo likewiſe on the other; it will no leſſe deterr him from offending in his preſence, who can punish vs, both temporally in this world, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the other, without all hope of appeale. <hi>I haue kept thy Commandements, &amp;c.</hi> (ſaith holy Dauid) <hi>becauſe all my wayes are in thy ſight; Pſal.</hi> 118. He giues the Preſence of God, as the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; meanes, by the helpe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he kept Gods holy law. This was that ſtrong buckler which defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded chaſt Ioſeph, and Suſanna from thoſe dangerous temptations, wherewith they were aſſaulted: <hi>for much better it is</hi> (ſaid shee) <hi>that by not yealding, I fall into your hands,</hi> then that I should <hi>ſinne in the ſight of God. Dan.</hi> 13. This was the Rule which God himſelfe preſcribed to holy Abraham; as a principall meanes for attayning to heigh Perfection: <hi>walke before me, and be perfect: Gen.</hi> 17. as if he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:172208:18"/>had ſaid: <hi>remember I ouerſee thee in all things; and thy deeds will be perfect.</hi> The reaſon hereof is moſt manifeſt: for as the beholding ſight of a ſeuere Iudge doth moſt powerfully reſtrayne vs from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending: ſo on the contrary, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth ſo much encourage, and incite the Soldier to generous acts, as doth the ſight of his King, or Generall, who can aboundantly reward him. And therefore it well appeares, how effectuall a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes this holy practiſe of Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Preſence now is, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and entire accomplishment of true Chriſtian iuſtice; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring vs moſt powerfully from the great euill of ſinne; and it as ſtrongly alſo ſpurrs vs on to doe good, by the practiſe of vertue; which are the two eſſentiall parts of this holy iuſtice; and are as two wings to the ſoule; whereof, if either of them be wanting, the other will little auaile her to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:172208:18"/>mount vp to her heauenly Bliſſe. By all which it appeares, both how neceſſary this holy practiſe is, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s according to the will of God: as alſo how needfull to curbe our vnruly paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: &amp; to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the diſordered affections of our minde. Finally it ſerues as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere, and awfull Maiſter, to deterr the boldeſt ſinner from offending him, who hath ſuch power, not only to inflict all temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment vpon him in this world; but alſo to condemne him, both body and ſoule to the eternall fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Hell. All which being manifeſt; it remaines that I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to declare, how this diuine Preſence of God may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by vs; and by what meanes it ought to be practiſed: for both which you may obſerue, that</p>
               <p>The firſt good helpe whereby to conceiue the diuine Preſence of God, is firmely to beleeue with S. Paul; that <hi>God is not farr from vs;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:172208:19"/>for we line, we mooue, and we are in him. Act.</hi> 17. Yea we ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſubſiſt by his ſupport, as should be withdraw his ſuſtayning hand, all creatures would returne to their former nothing, from whence he firſt extracted them: ſo that we are not only inwardly replenished with him; but he alſo encompaſſeth vs on euery ſide; for, <hi>both Heauen and Earth are fill'd with thy glory. Eſa.</hi> 6. Yea he is more intimately preſent to vs, then is our ſoule; becauſe he is the very eſſence of our ſoule; there gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to it, not only the operations which it makes in the body; but euen the exiſtence, and proper being of them both: <hi>for thou, ô Lord do'ſt all my actions: Eſa.</hi> 26. <hi>Nor is it I, but the grace of God with me,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) Where attributing his actions much rather to God's operation in him, then to his owne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by good conſequence, he was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:172208:19"/>there preſent vnto them: as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin did well conceiue, when he ſo greatly rebuked himſelfe for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing labored to ſeeke God abroad in his other Creatures, whom he ſo intimately enioy'd within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at home.</p>
               <p>A ſecond good expedient for this holy practiſe of Gods diuine Preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; is to contemplate his continuall benefitts, which (as the prime and principall cauſe) he communicates to vs by the inſtrumentall meanes of his other creatures; as light, by the Sunne; heate, by the fire; nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, by our food; reſpiration, by the ayre; &amp; all the reſt, both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, &amp; ſpirituall benefitts; which as by conueying conduits, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne bountifull hand: as the ſame S. Auguſtin did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe acknowledge, when giuing his immediate thankes vnto God for that firſt nourishment, which his diuine goodneſſe had ſo prouident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conueyed to him, by thoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der breaſtes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:172208:20"/>of his louing Nource And therefore (with this B. St.) due gratitude alſo exacts of vs, to keepe the eye of our ſoule vpon ſo continuall, a Benefactor; who prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally workes with his creatures all the good we receiue by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; though not to be perceiued by our corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eyes no more then we can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, either our ſoule, or the ayre; both which notwithſtanding be reall, true ſubſtances, &amp; are actually preſent with vs; for otherwiſe we could neither act, nor liue.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the more eaſie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending both the manner, and reality of Gods diuine Preſence; ſome fitly reſemble it to the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of a bright shining ſunne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a cleare tranſpare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t chriſtall; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nothing on anie ſide, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor without, is hidden from the eye: yea the leaſt mote, or ſtayne within the ſecret'ſt part of it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares as cleare, as doth the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour out-ſide of the ſame. In like
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:172208:20"/>condition are all creatures whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, in reſpect of God; to whom the darkeſt, &amp; profoundeſt corners within the bowels of the Earth; &amp; the moſt ſecret thoughts of our minde, &amp; conſciences, lye as open, as doth the shinning ſunne: which though it may iuſtly giue ſubiect of great terrour to the wicked; yet the vertuous ſoule may much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce to be continually in the vew of ſo louing a Father, and of ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully a protecting Lord.</p>
               <p>We being now ſufficiently aſſured of this diuine Preſence (whereof Faith permitts vs not to doubt) I will here alſo briefly endeauour to shew what profit may be drawne from this certaine treuth (which ought greatly to ioy a good Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian hart) to haue for eye-witneſſe of all we doe, that ſouueraigne Lord who beholding both our thoughts, words, &amp; deeds, rewards the leaſt of them eternally (it being done for his ſake) for this, vndoubtedly,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:172208:21"/>muſt ſtrongly incite a gratefull hart to aſpirations, both of loue, &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; as alſo to feare &amp; reuerence; whereby the vertuous ſoule vnites her ſelfe more cloſely to his ſacred Preſence, and laboring thus to gaine a holy habit of this diuine exerciſe; shee breathes fourth fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, and affectionate eiacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as fiery darts caſt vp vnto God from an enamoured ſoule, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with loue, &amp; which craues without art (yet with an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and tender feeling) with the Kingly Prophet; ſometymes for pardon of her ſinnes, and for grace to amend: ſometymes to be freed from a predominant vice, from ſome euill habit, or vnruly Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: ſometymes to obtayne ſuch vertues, as may make her moſt gratefull to God: ſometymes by bleſſing, praiſing, and adoring his diuine goodneſſe; when abroad in the fields, orgardens, shee beholds the Sunne, the Elements, the great
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:172208:21"/>fabrick of this world, or anie other creature, either of Heauen, or Earth, which that Almighty Creator hath made for the vſe of Man. Finally by raiſing her hart vnto God in producing holyacts of ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t loue; of deteſtation of ſinne; of profound Humility; of perfect Conformity; of willing Patience: &amp; to conclude, by ſuch other acts of vertue, as occaſion, and diuine inſpiration may beſt ſuggeſt: for by this good meanes, the ſoule preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues her ſelfe in a continuall practiſe of Gods heauenly Preſence; shee greatly preuents the worſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her ghoſtly enemie; &amp; by thus gaining a holy habit of God's diuine Preſence; with ioy, and great eaſe shee obtaynes holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to practiſe ſuch vertues, as be moſt needfull for her perfection in his diuine ſeruice, and shee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her eternall ſaluation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>But to reduce this ſo important
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:172208:22"/>a point, to an eaſie, and verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable practiſe; it is here firſt to be obſerued; that the chiefeſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this holy Exerciſe, conſiſts in the beginning, and verie firſt prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thereof; and therefore to gaine facility in practiſing the liuely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of God's diuine Preſence; your firſt endeauour muſt be, to haue both a good will, and true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to obtaine it: for a holy deſire is both aſſiſted by grace, and is alſo a powerfull ſpurr to nature, for the vſing all fitting endeauour to obtaine what is deſired.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt craue it of God, by very harty, and earneſt prayer, as being a <hi>perfect guift, deſcending from the Father of lights;</hi> from which holy fountaine we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it, much rather then from anie humaine art, or induſtry.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not omit here to giue you, as a moſt neceſſary aduertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that you begin to practiſe this holy Exerciſe gently, and by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:172208:22"/>degrees with all prudent modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Firſt calling Gods Preſence to mind at each ſtriking of the clock; then after endeauour the ſame at the beginning, and end of all your chiefeſt actions; for by often iterated acts, habits are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; and this Exerciſe, which at firſt ſemed teadious and difficult; by perſeuerance and practiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes both pleaſing, and verie eaſie to be renewed in all the reſt of your actions; God being euer preſent in all places; and therefore moſt eaſie to be found.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be obſerued; that ſome, by intemperate feruour, exceeding in this holy Exerciſe the due limitts of diſcretion, and ſtrayning the faculty of their imagination aboue it's power; by ſtriuing actually to exerciſe a continuall Preſence of God; they much weaken the head, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelues thereby vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:172208:23"/>for other duties of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which is a moſt conuincing argument, that it proceeds not from the Spirit of God; that being truly gentle, and ſweet. <hi>wiſd.</hi> 10. And leadeth none to ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate extremities; which are but the effects of our owne ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and not of the true loue of God; which is neuer to be found deſtitute of ſolid true wiſdome, and Prudence.</p>
               <p>You haue now here ſeene, both how neceſſary, and verie profitable this holy Exerciſe of Gods diuine Preſence is for all ſuch as aſpire to Chriſtian Perfection. It remaines that I conclude this Rule, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing briefly, what exceeding great harme the neglect thereof doth cauſe both to body, &amp; ſoule:it being moſt certaine, and manifeſt, that as the memory of Gods diuine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence mainely deterres vs from ſinne; ſo likewiſe the neglect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:172208:23"/>is moſt truly accompted the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſource, &amp; fountaine of all impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>for God is not before the eyes</hi> of the wicked (ſaith the holy King) <hi>and therefore all their wayes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with ſinne. Pſal.</hi> 10. For from hence proceeds their booldneſſe &amp; temerity in offending him. To this the Prophet Ezechiel attributes the enormous wickedneſſe of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: and for the ſelfſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a ſinner is moſt truly qualifi'd by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>a Foole; becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in his heart, he ſaith, there is no God: Pſal.</hi> 52. That publike ſinner Thais, being happily ſtrucke by a ſerious reflexion of God's behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the foulneſſe of her offenſes; shee therevpon forſooke her ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſe; and retyring to a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall life, shee ended the reſt of her dayes in great repentance, and ſanctity.</p>
               <p>This was the happy effect of Gods diuine Preſence remembred by that happy ſinner. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:172208:24"/>should we but liuely conceiue this ſacred Preſence; it would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leige vs to much more reuerent, and deuout reſpect at our prayers; as alſo to refraine from offending in other occaſions, that dreadfull, and all ouerſeeing Maieſty.</p>
               <p>You haue now had in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Rule, the Theory of God's diuine Preſence; and by which is only lay'd the foundation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this next is to build; by redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the former to practiſe; which is the proper ſubiect of</p>

            <div n="2" type="rule">
               <head>THE SECOND RVLE. <hi>Regulating all our actions from our vpriſing; vntill we goe to bed.</hi>

               <p>THE former Rule informing our vnderſtanding with that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:172208:24"/>great treuth of Gods diuine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: it is but requiſit, that, by this, the will should be excited to the holy practiſe thereof; in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to his ſacred Maieſty due honour and homage, by all our actions of the day: for he hauing ſo mercifully redeemed vs from eternall thraldome by the price of his deareſt blood; both iuſtice, and gratitude makes all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (by an infinit degree) more due vnto him, then anie Prince, or Parent can pretend from either child, or ranſom'd ſlaue.</p>
               <p>And to performe our duty right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly herein to him, by the practiſe of this good Rule; it mainely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports vs to begin well the day; to which the remainder doth ſo vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſponde.

               <p>Firſt then, ſo ſoone as you are fully awake; hauing taken conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient reſt, and your vſuall repoſe: it being alſo now your tyme to riſe (and no incommodity, nor indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition being offered to hinder you) make preſently the ſigne of the Croſſe, thereby to inuoke the diuine aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the moſt bleſſed Trinity, through the merits of CHRISTS holy Paſſion: and at the firſt morning light appearing to your eyes, ſalute with all cordiall reuerence, and deuotion that bright heauenly Sonne of Iuſtice, IESVS-CHRIST, ſaying: <hi>O ſweet</hi> IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS <hi>the true light of our ſoules; illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate my vnderſtanding, I beſeech thee, and inflame my will; to the end that I may know thee, loue thee, and ſerue thee, both this day, and euer-more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for your better beginning of the day; endeauour alſo to giue God your firſt action thereof, by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:172208:25"/>a vertuous act of Mortification; shakeing off all ſloath and drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that would detayne you with loſſe of precious tyme: which holy Act, you may offer to God, as the firſt fruit of that new day, moſt due vnto him, and ſo very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull; as it may pourchace a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py bleſſing vpon all the reſt you shall doe therein. Finally omitt not to acknowledge with due gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude this ſo graciouſly preſeruing you that night from all euill: and his mercy in affording you the good beginning of that day; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by his grace, you may nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the moſt important worke of your Saluation; by louing, and ſeruing him with much more care, and fidelity, then formerly you haue done.</p>
               <p>Secondly in further thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for his ſo innumerable great benefitts; offer your ſelfe entyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both body and ſoule, with all their powers, and ſenſes to his

               <p>Thirdly craue his diuine grace to preſerue you that day from all grieuous ſinne; and propoſe firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on your part, to auoyde all ſuch occaſions, as former frailties may giue you iuſt reaſon to feare. And reſolue in particular moſt careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shunne that ſinne, to which you finde your ſelfe moſt ſubiect; and to exerciſe the actes of that vertue which moſt oppoſeth the ſame. Adde alſo to this, an act of oblation to God, of a moſt willing acceptation (for his loue) of all the Croſſes, and troubles which may happen that day, and during your whole life. Renounce all euill temptations to ſinne; all inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

And in caſe that by frailty, you shall tranſgreſſe againſt your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning good purpoſe: yet this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing act not being reuoked; your intention ſtands good, and your tranſgreſſion inuoluntary; and thereby, will either not be crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the ſight of God; or at the leaſt, the malice of it will be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminished.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; raiſe feruently your heart, and minde vnto God, and treate with him the chiefe neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your ſoule by holy prayer;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:172208:27"/>which is as needfull to a ſpirituall life, and aduancement in vertue, as is the water to growing plants. Begge humbly his diuine light to vnderſtand his bleſſed will; and to enable you by his grace to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the ſame. Which preparation to your prayer being made</p>
               <p>Fiftly compoſe your ſelfe deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the place of prayer, as in the diuine Preſence of God; where, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your knees, firſt humbly and lowly bowe, or kiſſe the ground, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment that you are earth, to which you muſt returne: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in humble, and gratefull memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the moſt bleſſed Incarnation of the Sonne of God. Adore his diuine Preſence, who became Man for our Redemption. Next ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keing the ſigne of the holy Croſſe vpon your forehead, mouth, and breaſt (as ſealing, and shutting vp thereby the doore of your heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all prophane words, thoughts and deeds for that tyme) retire

O my moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Father, and dreadful Iudge; am I now in that condition, and ſtate for my conſcience, wherein I should be content to be found at the houre of my death!</hi> O when shal I truly loue thee with my whole hart and ſoule, or as compoſing your ſelfe to reſt at the foot of the ſacred Croſſe, rehearſe theſe bleſſed words which IESVS-CHRIST pronounced there to his Heauenly Father: <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into thy hands I commend my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Luke</hi> 23. Recite this holy Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with great feruour, loue, and humility; beſeech him ſo to imprint it in your hart and ſoule; as that you may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude your life, &amp; laſt breath in pronouncing theſe ſacred words in vnion of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and diſpoſition, wherein IESVS-CHRIST proſented that

                  <p>I will conclude this Rule with a very ſerious admonition to all ſuch as it may moſt concerne; which is that they ſo regulate the houre of their going to bed; that hauing had ſufficient time for their reſt, they may riſe in a good houre in the morning; not conuerting day into night, and night into day; to the great preiudice, both of their corporall, and ſpiritual health: as alſo to the exceeding hinderance of their whole dayes employment, totally peruerting the naturall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which God hath ordained vs, who made the night for repoſe; and the day, wherein to labour and expedite our affaires.</p>

               <p>Bleſſed <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtin is as effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and cleare in declaring to vs the neceſſity of holy Prayer, as he hath been to manifeſt its happy fruits; aſſuring vs, that Prayer is as neceſſary for the ſoul, as is aire, or food for the body: without which, as it cannot liue; ſo neither can the ſoule continue long in its ſpirituall life of grace, without the holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Prayer: which is to her as a furnace is to iron: for that mettle although of it ſelfe it bee both hard, ſtiff, and cold, yet being caſt into the furnace, it becomes hot, bright, and plyable to what forme the workman shall pleaſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, but a short time out of the forge, returnes to its former naturall qualities, and becomes as ſtiff and cold as before. It is iuſt ſo with our ſoul, which through its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prau'd nature, is both cold, &amp; very vnplyable to vertue, vnleſs it be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:172208:44"/>heated by the holy fire of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; from which it cannot long be ſeparated, but it looſeth fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and returnes to its former bad inclination, and ſinfull habits againe.</p>
               <p>Hauing here briefly diſcourced of the neceſſity, and great fruit of holy Prayer; I cannot omit to ſay ſomething alſo of the force, and ſingular efficacie of the ſame: and how powerful a meanes, it is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine at Gods hands all our corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and ſpirituall neceſſities; as by Gods holy helpe, I shal endeauour to prooue by ſeuerall moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt examples, both out of the old and new Teſtaments. As firſt may well appeare in that dangerous, &amp; great encounter betwixt Amalech, and the Children of Iſrael; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo long as Moyſes lifted vp his hands to pray; the Iſraelits preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but if (through wearineſs) his armes failed to continue that holy poſture; their enemies gain'd
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:172208:44"/>the aduantage ſo that in Moſes his prayers, conſiſted their ſtrength and victory. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. And how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten he at other times, by feruent prayer with held Gods hand, euen ready to ſtrike a deſerued reuenge vpon rhoſe rebellious people, as may be ſeene in the ſame chapter.</p>
               <p>The like powerfull effect had his holy prayers for thoſe ſinfull people. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10. God there ſaying to Moſes: <hi>Pray not for this people, nor hinder me thereby from punishing them.</hi> And <hi>Exod</hi> 23. wee ſee how, in a maner, he held Gods hands, from thundering fourth his deſtroying wrath vpon that rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious generation, for their adoring the golden calfe: <hi>Suffer me that my wrath may be power'd forth againſt them;</hi> as if hee had held him by force from deſtroying him. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.23. and 24 <hi>he ſaid, he would deſtroy them; if Moyſes his elect, had not ſtood in the way before
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:172208:45"/>him, to turne aſide his wrath, that he might not deſtroy them.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Ioſue by his prayer, ſtayd the courſe of the Sunne, vntill he had accomplisht a glorious Victory ouer his enemies. <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 10. Eſa. by prayer, cauſed the ſame Sunne, to goe backe in fauour of King Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias, ten whole lines of the dyall: and the ſame King Ezechias by his feruent prayer, retarded death it ſelfe, fifteene whole yeares, which was before vpon the very point to haue ſeiſed vpon him. <hi>Kings</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>And ſince the Law of grace, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods Saints, by prayer haue raiſed the dead. <hi>S.</hi> Gregor. Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturgus
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:172208:45"/>(ſo called by reaſon of ſo great a number of ſtupendious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which he wrought) dryed vp a great lake by his prayer, to reconcile a mortall diſcord which it cauſed betwixt two contentious brothers. Hee remoued a great mountaine, to make place for the building a Church. He fixing his walking ſtaff into the banke of a Riuer, which by its freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations vſed exceedingly to preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice all the territories about, that drie ſtaff prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſprouted fourth, and grew vp to a great tree, and by his prayers became the limited bounds of that vnruly riuer, which it neuer afterwards exceeded.</p>
               <p>And to conclude; Zonaras re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that <hi>S.</hi> Baſil by his prayers open'd the faſt shutt dores of the Church at Nice; (which the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians could not effect by theirs) in the preſence of Valence the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: who had propoſed that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to prooue, whether the

               <p>By all which their prodigious miracles, we plainly ſee the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te power, and force of prayer, and we shall need no better proofe to manifeſt how ſtrongly it preuailes with God for whatſoeuer we shall but rightly demande. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will now proceed; and shew</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>VVHAT EXTERIOVR preparation is required for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and what interiour conditions are neceſſary to make it gratful to God, and fruitfull to our ſouls: wherein conſiſts the chiefe point of this good Rule, for holy Prayer.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt for the exteriour prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a conuenient place is to be aſſigned to prayer, which may be ſolitary, quiet, and free from
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:172208:46"/>noiſe, and company.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, certaine appointed, and conuenient times are to be ſet apart for this holy exerciſe, which (without fitting cauſe) we muſt not omit, nor change.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the compoſition of the body muſt be modeſt, deuout, and humble: as bare head, and vpon our knees, with ioyned, and eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hands, like criminels, crauing the mercy of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, our words muſt be alſo rauerently pronounced, and ſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely as to bee diſtinctly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: for as it would be eſteemed an exceeding inciuility to ſpeake ſo conſuſedly faſt to a temporall Prince; as that wee could not bee vnderſtood, ſo much more ſinfull irreuerence it is, to ſpeake with the King of Heauen, in hudling out ſo faſt our words in Prayer, as that, euen wee our ſelues should not know that which we ſo mutter to Almighty God.</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:172208:47"/>
                  <p>Now concerning the interiour conditions required for holy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (true faith being firſt ſuppoſed, without which the Apoſtle tells vs, that, <hi>it is impoſsible to pleaſe God. Heb.</hi> 11.) the next neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (and required alſo by ſaint Paul) is Charity, without which, euen Faith it-ſelfe (he ſaith) would nothing auaile him. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. and for want of which vertue, both the Prayers, and Sacrifices of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Cain were vtterly rejected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he made his offering with a hart full of rancor, &amp; enuie againſt Abel, his innocent brother. And therefore, if going to make our prayer, and oblation vnto God, wee finde in our hart any grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, or breach of Charity towards our neighbour; our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe expreſly commands vs, to lay downe our offering; and hauing firſt made our peace, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, then to bring our offering, and not before. <hi>Math</hi> 5.</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:172208:47"/>
                  <p>The ſecond interiour condition is, by purity of intention to ſeeke the true end of prayer, without which it would be vaine and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; now the true and pure end of all good prayer, is humbly to craue thereby a light from God to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his holy will, and grace to performe the ſame; as alſo increaſe in his loue, and aduancement in vertue; a true conformity to his bleſſed will, with a reall contempt and abnegation of our-ſelues; not ſeeking our owne ſenſible guſt, or ſpirituall conſolation, but renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all curioſity of ſpirit, and ſelf loue; to ſeeke onely and purely Gods glory, and not our owne ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by Prayer: for in that we ſeeke not God, ſo much as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and our owne intereſt; and therefore no maruaile, if we finde him not.</p>
                  <p>A third condition yet required for holy prayer, is the vertue of Mortification; for ſuch is the great
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:172208:48"/>connexion of theſe two vertues, as the one is neuer to be found in any eminentdegree, or perfection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other: the reaſon thereof is cleare, for if the hart be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wth vaine, or ſenſuall delights, it is not capable of true ſpirituall, and heauenly contents: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that we finde ſo few en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with this holy vertue of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becauſe there are ſo few, who are truly mortified: for who hath obtained the vertue of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will ſoone gett the vertue of prayer; the firſt diſpoſing vs vnto the ſecond: for ſince wee cannot liue in this world without affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſome content, or other; therefore it is, that if we hate, and depriue our ſelues of theſe wordly contents, we shall eaſily ſeeke out diuine, and heauenly comforts, by the meanes of holy praier; which doth neceſſarily require</p>
                  <p>Attention, the third condition, &amp; without which our praier would
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:172208:48"/>be but plaine hypocriſie, and by voluntary diſtraction, it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vice, and much rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke Gods anger againſt vs, then appeaſe his wrath: for God being a ſpirit, in ſpirit we muſt adore him (ſaith ſaint Iohn 4.) and therefore only lipp-prayer, without the hart, (according to ſaint Iſidore) is no prayer at all; Prayer being as ſaint Iohn Damaſcen defines it; <hi>an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the hart to God;</hi> without which, they are moſt iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by the holy Ghoſt, who praiſe God with their lips, but haue their harts farr from him: Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being without attention, but as the shell without fruit; which, as it would bee rigthly offenſiue to preſent to a mortall Prince, with much more reaſon a farr greater crime it is, to preſent our prayer to God without attention; which is as the shell without the kernell; or as the body without a ſoule: yea meere verbal Prayer without
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:172208:49"/>attention of the minde, is but a corporall action, and no prayer at all, which requires an eleuation of the hart, with pious affection, and attention of the ſoul. Prayer final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is properly called a vertue of Religion, and conſiſts not only in the corporeall, or materiall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the body; but chiefly in the powers of the ſoule, and in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall actions thereof, which muſt be interiour, and truly ſpirituall; for otherwiſe it could be no true worship of God; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence no act of the vertue of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it not proceeding from the interiour operation of the ſoule, by which God muſt be worshiped, as ſaint Iohn hath told vs. c. 4.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo here to be noted, that prayer is not the end; but rather the meanes vnto perfection: and therefore, that our prayer may be profitable, we muſt raiſe vp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome pious affections; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from thence good purpoſes
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:172208:49"/>and reſolutions for the actual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſome determinate vertue; or for auoyding ſome particular vice; for ſome certaine good act to the glory of God, or to amende ſome particular imperfection; or finally to practiſe ſome vertuous act of mortification for the loue of God, and the like: for in this conſiſts the true profit of prayer; and by ſo praying, it will be both holy, and good; be it neuer ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid, or drye; yea it will be both pleaſing to God, and verie profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our ſoules; though wholy paſt ouer with, what inuoluntary, and troubleſome diſtractions ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>
                  <p>The fourth condition (and the principall) whereby to make our prayer efficacious to obtaine what we aske (and by which, both it and all our other actions ought to be regulated) is to preſent it in the name of IESVS-CHRIST as S. Paul recommends to vs, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:172208:50"/>
                     <hi>Vvhatſoeuer ye doe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>either by word, or by deed; doe it all in the name of</hi> IESVS-CHRIST. And he himſelfe alſo aſſures vs; that all which we aske of his Father, we shall obtaine it vndoubtedly; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided we demaunde it in the name of his deare Sonne IESVS. <hi>Io.</hi> 14.15. and 16. that is; in his ſpirit, and with ſuch diſpoſitions, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in our prayer, as he gaue vs example in this world to doe.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to this end, vnite your prayers vnto his, performe them in true loue &amp; charity, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, puritie, feruour and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the beſt you can, and in all thoſe other diſpoſitions, and holy intentions, wherewith our louing Redeemer was accuſtomed to pray vnto his Heauenly Father, whil'ſt hee was here amongſt vs vpon Earth.</p>
                  <p>The fifth condition is, to place our ſelues in Gods preſence with profound humilitie, and a contrite
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:172208:50"/>hart for all our ſinnes: ackowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our owne great vnworthineſs to appeare in his ſight, or to be heard by him; as not being able of our ſelues to haue the leaſt good thought, nor performe the leaſt gratefull act to God: but relying wholy vpon the ſacred merits of IESVS-CHRIST, in which hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſurance, we may demand of his Eternall Father, a ſupply of all our neceſſities, both ſpirituall and temporall; together with all other celeſtiall graces for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt condition required for true &amp; fruitfull prayer, is an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confidence, with conſtant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance and true fidelity in this diuine exerciſe: for God requireth it in verie manie things, which he will not grant vs, but by conſtant perſeuerance, and long demaund: thereby the more to exerciſe our humility; as alſo to make his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious guifts to bee the more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by vs.</p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:172208:51"/>
                  <p>In fine the qualities, and due properties, accompanying true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fruitfull prayer, are theſe: Reſpect, Attention, Feruency, Faith, Hope, Charity, Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſtant perſeuerance in the greateſt barreneſs and ſterility of all Deuotion; yea should we be as it were ouerwhelmed with great diſtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; diſſipatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de; wherin perchaunce the vertuous ſoule may greatly be afflicted thr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough feare of offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding; whereas by her patient ſuffering, &amp; holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, shee becomes more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull vnto God, then by the moſt feruent praier, bedewed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teares of verie ſenſible, and tender deuotion: for in that our nature receiues both ſolace, and reward; but by holie patience and fidelitie in ſeruing God in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid drineſſe, and want of all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible conſolation; shee ſerues him for pure loue, and much more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly; it being without all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Concerning comfort, in inuoluntary diſtractions in Prayer, and the remedy againſt them.</head>
                     <p>For the comfort of ſuch as are afflicted with importunate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluntary diſtractions in Prayer, S. Baſil aſſures vs, that God is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended by ſuch, as be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, with ſufficient aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſent, ſtaying wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, and on ſet purpoſe in ſuch diſtractions in our prayer; which is indeed ſinfull irreuerence; and diſreſpect to Gods diuine preſence, to which they pretended to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by Prayer. And therefore (according to S. Chryſoſtome) vnto ſuch we may iuſtly ſay: <hi>How canſt thou expect that God should
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:172208:52"/>heare or harken vnto thee; ſeeing that thou doſt not harken vnto thy ſelfe?</hi> But if vſing our beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to reſiſt ſuch euill diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they yet returne; and that through our naturall infirmity we remaine wholy diſtracted, &amp; voide of all actuall attention in our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; God is not offended thereby; but mooued much rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; he well knowing our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and the great frailty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nature. For as a louing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compaſſionateth the naturall maladies of his children; much more tender is our Heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to all ſuch, as loue and ſerue him: for he well knows of what fraile mettle we are made, <hi>Pſal. 108.</hi> and therefore he will not be angry in ſeeing vs fall into thoſe our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall miſeries, and imperfections againſt our will; which we ſtriuing to reſiſt, they are but as a combat to cauſe vs much merit, &amp; to make our praier ſo much the more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:172208:52"/>by how much wee ſuffered therein with holy Patience, thoſe troubleſome diſttactions, whereby Almighty God made tryal of our fidelity: for we make a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prayer when wee offer to God the amorous affections of our loue, with actuall ſufferance for his ſake of thoſe things which much diſpleaſe vs: yea then it beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that we truly loue him for his owne ſake, and not for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and ſpirituall guſts, which he often communicats at other times: and the happy ſoule which in this ſort shall riſe humbly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (yea though euen ouerwhelmed with ſuch inuoluntary diſtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) shee may rejoice, and be greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted, for hauing made to God ſo gratefull a prayer and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable alſo, peraduenture, then it would haue been without the leaſt diſtraction; God being greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with an humble, and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned will and of this we may make

And now although by this the timorours ſoule may be comforted in all her importante, &amp; inuoluntary diſtractions in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: yet I will not omit to giue this one good remedy more, by a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent ejaculation, compoſed in this manner out of the very words of that great Maiſter of ſpirituallity, bleſſed Auila: which the troubled ſoule, as proſtrate at the feet of IESVS-CHRIST, may rehearſe. <hi>My Souueraine deare Lord; ſo farr as this my greateſt ſterility, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted minde proceeds from any fault and negligence of mine; I am hartely ſorry for giuing the occaſion thereof: but if it hath been thy diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne pleaſure to permit them for due punishment of my ſinne; I moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly receiue them, as a moſt fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:172208:53"/>chaſtiſement from thy moſt holy hand: only grant me thy grace, ſweet</hi> IESVS, <hi>I beſeech thee, that I nowaiſe offende thee thereby; nor be depriued of the holy fruit of my praier.</hi> Say this from a ſincere, &amp; louing hart; &amp; doubt not but by your patience, Humility, and Reſignation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuering the beſt you can in holy prayer; you shal receaue both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and conſolation: nor will you looſe your reward which he hath promiſſed to all them who vſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and their beſt endeauour to deſerue it.</p>
                     <p>Dart vp your hart vnto God, and ſay to him in milde and humble cofidence: <hi>Ieſu the Sonne of Dauid haue mercy on me, Mark 10.</hi> knock your breaſt, and in the repentant ſpirit of the humble Publican, ſay: <hi>God be mercifull to me a moſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſinner,</hi> that I am, &amp; doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt iuſtly experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that my ſoule is like drie, and barren earth before thee, without one drop of

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:172208:54"/>pleaſing to himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Finally let theſe diſtractions in prayer be neuer ſo importunate, and this ſpirituall deſolation neuer ſo anxious, yea although we should conceiue probably that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from our owne ſinfull ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence and infidelity, yet we muſt not diſquiet our hart for them; but we ought rather with true humble patience to receiue them as due punishment of our former ſinne: for by ſo doing we may be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured, in the great mercy of God, that he will turne all to our greater good; ſuppoſing that wee faithfully obſerue theſe three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things. Firſt that we take occaſion thence to humble our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues the more. Secondly, that no trouble nor deiection cauſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by driue vs from the practiſe of our accuſtomed, and approoued vertuous exerciſes. And thirdly that we employ out faithfull diligence to auoide ſuch faults, as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:172208:55"/>contribute vnto thoſe diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, and diſſipation of our minde.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay: how can my prayers be gratefull to God, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing my hart and ſoule encombred with ſo many euill thoughts, and peruerſe inclinations? I anſwer, that it is one thing to feele the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and an other to conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: giue no conſent to it, and you are ſo free from any offence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; as contrariwiſe it ſerues you as a good occaſion to encreaſe your merit in the ſight of God: and it alſo confirmes you much more in true vertue, and will finally be ſure of a moſt happy reward. I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with this aduertiſement, for the better auoiding theſe vſual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments of the happy effect of prayer.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is want of reconcilement by charity with our neighbour, which made the ſacrifice of ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Caine to be reiected by God,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:172208:55"/>as hath beene already obſerued.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hardneſſe of hart to to the poore, is alſo a ſinne which much hindreth vs to obtaine the effect of our Prayer: for how can we hope to haue God bountifull to our ſelues, when we deny to the poore what they aske of vs for his ſake: <hi>He that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore; himſelfe alſo shall cry &amp; shall not be heard. Prou.</hi> 21. <hi>Giue, and there shall be giuen to you, for with the ſame meaſure that you mete, it shall be meaſured to you againe. Luke 5.6.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The vnfittingneſſe of what we aske, is oftentimes a hinderance to the obtaining it: So Saint Peter asked what was hurtfull, when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amored with the glory of CHRISTS Transfiguration, he deſired to ſtay in that manner with him for euer: but God sheweth his loue as much in denying our prayers when they are hurtefull, as in granting them when they are profitable to vs: and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:172208:56"/>therefore we ought to bee as well content and tankefull to God for the one, as for the other, &amp; neuer to repine at the not obtayning of our prayers: for if we haue not our deſire, we haue that which is better for vs, if wee conforme our wills vnto the will of God. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euet well obſerue Gods manifeſt and bleſſed prouidence in denying him ſome things which hee hath begged by prayer, will vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly perceiue, yea and be forced alſo to confeſſe in his hart, that Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſcendence to his petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would haue been much to his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: but God of his goodneſſe not giuingway to our ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for our hurt; grants not that which we then did imagine to be for our good, but that which he certainly knowes to be beſt for vs.</p>
                     <p>Theſe now are briefly the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt obſtacles, which hinder the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red effect of our prayer; to wit, the guilt of our grieuous ſinne;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:172208:56"/>hardneſſe of hart towards our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the poore; want of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent attention, &amp; deuotion in our prayers; and the vnfittingneſſe of what we deſire, which would be to our greater harme, should we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſame. Which obſtacles may beſt be preuented, by puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our intention in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Prayer; and by examining our vſuall comportement in that holy Exerciſe; what time we allow for it? with what feruour, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and attention we performe the ſame? Alas the leaſt time which we ſpend in it ſeemes tedious, and very long; whereas we thinke the reſt but short, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed in wordly and trifling vanities. Which being well conſidered, wee ought not to maruaile at our groſſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and little guſt in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes our ſpirituall, and heauenly felicity; we being ſo very neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to craue Gods needfull grace for that effect, &amp; which he only grants
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:172208:57"/>to ſuch, as humbly, and feruently begg it at his hands.</p>
                     <p>By all theſe premiſſes, wee may now ſufficiently vnderſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of holy Prayer; as alſo the fruicts, the neceſſity, and the force thereof: what preparation, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conditions are required to make it efficacious to obtaine what we aske; what we muſt doe when aſſaulted with inuoluntary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate diſtractions: and finally what are the obſtacles which make our payer inefficacious for obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what we deſire; wherin though I haue been lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then the breuity of a meere practical Rule might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; yet for that the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a thing which is very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious doth ſtirr vp a great deſire to obtaine the ſame; therefore I hope my labour will neither be loſt, nor yet prooue vngratefull, in laying open thus amply both the nature, and happy fruit of holy Prayer; whereby a vertuous ſoule will be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:172208:57"/>moued to be much more ſerious and aſſiduous in the deuout pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>It now only remaines, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you ſome ſett forme and order for your vſuall and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer; which neuertheleſs you may change, &amp; to which you may adde, according to your owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, &amp; the aduiſe of your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or Goſtly Father, with whome, both vertue &amp; diſcretion requires that you should freely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all your ſett practiſes of piety: and thereby you will the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Gods diuine pleaſure; and keepe your zeale &amp; deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much more ſecurely within the bounds of diſcretion, and true vertue; by renouncing your owne ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in humble ſubmiſſion vnto him, whom you haue choſen ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually to aſſiſt, and direct you; and by him, to vnderſtand the will of God.</p>

                  <p>Now concerning this order, or ſett forme for our daily prayer, it might bee ſufficient to remit you to the manuel, and other good bookes of deuotion; out of which your owne diſcretion is beſt able to make a choice (as I doubt not but you haue already done) moſt ſuteable to your preſent condition, for the which your obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is very great to God, for his affording you ſo gracious a fauour of much good leaſure, and opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to conuerſe ſoe familiarly with him, both by reading, and prayer: whereof they are depriued who are of a meaner condition: and therefore, as well in due gratitude, as alſo the better to correſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with ſo happy a condition; you may make vſe of theſe, or of ſome other deuotions, as God shall beſt inſpire you; or as ſome good ſpirituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector

                  <p>After your firſt morning obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, and rectifying of your intention for al your actions of the day: I muſt in the next place recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, one little halfe houre of mentall prayer. And as for the methode to be practiſed therein, I remit you to the great Bishop of Geneua Francis de Sales of moſt happy memory, in his firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of his Introduction to a deuout life; where you shall ſee a short, plaine, and eaſie methode for making of mental prayer. Your meditation ended, heare Maſs (if you can) in honour and adorarion of IESVS-CHRIST there truly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in that holy Sacrifice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the price of our Redemption is applyed in expiation of our ſinne; which doth farr ſurpaſſe in payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that debt, all other ſatisfaction whatſoeuer; whether by faſting, prayer or any corporall auſterity;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:172208:59"/>it being the infinit ſatisfaction of IESVS-CHRIST, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by applied to our ſouls.

Say daily our Ladis office, and your beades, according to the ſeuerall myſteries thereof: and reade towards the euening the Saints life for the next day; obſeruing with good leaſure what vertues you shal finde therein moſt neceſſary for your owne practiſe: and make it the ſubiect of your next morning reſolution, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome good acts thereof, as occaſion may be offered; and craue humbly that Saints interceſſion to God, to obtaine you grace for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing ſo needfull a vertue into your ſoule.</p>
                  <p>There is yet one thing more, which both for its piety, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:172208:59"/>may well chalenge a prime place amongſt our deuotions; the Letanies (I meane) of that moſt ſweet, and adorable name of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS, which you haue in the Key of paradiſe, and other bookes.

                  <p>This ſpeciall Examen of our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity concerning the performance of our mornings Reſolution, and ſubiect of this our particular Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is ordinarly to be made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before dinner, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and in the ſpace of ſaying fiue <hi>Pater noſters</hi> (at the moſt) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keing for the ſubiect thereof (and as a particular taske) either the gaining ſome needfull vertue, or the extirpation of ſome determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vice moſt predominant in our ſoules and of moſt ſcandall to our

                  <p>I Will conclude this holy Exerciſe in anſwering thoſe two vſuall obiections, which moſt trouble the more vnlearned ſorte. Firſt, that it is not ſaid in the vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but in Latine, which moſt doe not vnderſtand. And ſecondly, that the Prieſt pronounceth alſo ſome parte of it, ſo ſecretly to himſelfe, as they cannot heare
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:172208:112"/>what he ſaith.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt, this anſwere might ſuffice; that thoſe three holy lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, Hebrewe, Greeke, and Latine, hauing been ſanctified by that ſacred title vpon the holy Croſſe; we may well preſume, that they remayned euer after, more gratefull to God, more venerable both to Angels and Men, &amp; much more dreadfull doubtleſſe to the Diuell, our mortall and ghoſtly enemie then anie other; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who can iuſtly blame our holy, and prudent Mother the Cath Church (inſpired by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt) to teach her beloued children, to praiſe and glorifie this our deare Redeemer IESVS-CHRIST, in her chiefeſt facrifice and ſeruice in a language, which had ſerued at his ſacred Paſſion to publish his glorious triumph vpon the Croſſe, and there to declare him to the full view of the world; that he was; IESVS NAZARENVS
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:172208:112"/>REX IVDAEORVM? <hi>John.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I anſwere, that ſince the Latine Church was founded by the Apoſtles; it hath euer vſed this tongue, both for the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and her lyturgies: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may iuſtly conceiue her too ancient, and our aduerſaries ouer yoong, to teach this our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, and ſo aged Mother, now to begin to ſpeake: this hauing been the ancient language in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland (as S. Bede doth auouch) at the verie firſt plantation of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity amongſt the English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and therefore by good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, this practiſe of ſaying Maſſe in the latine tongue, muſt needs (at leaſt) be full as ancient, as their Chriſtendoome.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, euen reaſon it ſelfe makes it manifeſt, that as God himſelfe is one; and euer the ſame immutable; and his Church vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall, and moſt truly Catholike; and not of one Nation, but of all:
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:172208:113"/>ſo alſo, ought his diuine and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike ſeruice, to be performed in one generall, immutable, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall tongue; and not in a vulgar which is not underſtood perchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce two hundred miles in length; and which euery age is verie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to alter: whereas the Latine tongue is generall ouer Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doome; and is now the verie ſame, that it was in Cicero his tyme, aboue ſeauenteen hundred yeares a goe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, should this the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike ſeruice of the Church be ſaid in euery vulgar language; few Prieſts would be able to exerciſe that function out of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Cuntry; as Miniſters muſt needs confeſſe, who trauaile into other Kingdomes; although it be where there owne religion may be profeſſed (as they pretend] and therefore, thy muſt of neceſſity be ſilent abroad, or ſtay at home: whereas Catholike Prieſts ſerue
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:172208:113"/>God after the ſelffame manner in euery place; and all people, in all countries whatſoeuer find the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike ſeruice to be the ſame; and well know how to ſerue God the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, it is moſt worthy of note; that euen the Iewes, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; Abiſſins, and Ruſſians vſe one of theſe three holy languages, Hebrew, Greek, or Latine; and none of them employ their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vulgar tongue for the publick ſeruice of their Church, nether are the holy Scriptures written therein: yea <hi>Actes</hi> 15.21. We reade that euerie ſaturday, the Iewes in their Synagogue did reade the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture to the People in the Hebrew tongue (as all confeſſe) which was much differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from their vulgar; and yet our bleſſed Sauiour found no fault with them for it.</p>
                  <p>And whereas they obiect that by our ſeruice in Latine, we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e neither edification, nor yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:172208:114"/>for good life. I anſwere, that experience giues all the world a fufficient proofe; that our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were as wiſe and deuout to God; as faithfull, and charitable to their neighbours; as obſeruant of Gods lawes: that ſeruants were as true, children as obedient, Magiſtrates as iuſt, and Chriſtians as likely to be ſaued, as in anie ſect of theirs, which pretendes to the greateſt purity, and beſt reforme.</p>
                  <p>And though it be not denyed, to be both conuenient, and verie laudable alſo, for particular people to ſay their prayers in the knowne and vulgar tongue: yet the Prieſt, who is the publike Miniſter of the Church; and offereth vp to God the publike prayer, and ſacrifice for the whole vniuerſall Church: he likewiſe ought to vſe a generall, and vniuerſall tongue: as moſt common to all for whome he prayes, and offers ſacrifice: but it is nowayes needfull, that all the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:172208:114"/>common People should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that tongue: it being the Prieſt, not they, who prayeth in the perſon of all the reſt to God, who vnderſtandeth all tongues a like.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I will ſay no more of this: but conclude with <hi>S.</hi> Aug. that, to <hi>diſpute, or call in queſtion thoſe things which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obſerued in the Church is a moſt inſolent madneſſe: Epiſ.</hi> 118. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</p>

                  <p>I anſwere that our Aduerſaries migh eaſily diſcharge their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled minds from this needleſſe ſcruple: would they but pleaſe to informe themſelues by our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:172208:115"/>who treate vpon the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and ſeruice of the holy Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe: whereby they might be plainely informed how ſignificantly we are put in minde by this ſilence, of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me principall actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our bleſſed Sauiour his life: as may appeare: firſt by the prayer, or ſecret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Preface: whereby we are put in minde of that prayer, which IESVS-CHRIST, did thrice repeate in the garden: there praying priuately vnto his heauenly Father, proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te vpon the ground, in that his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agonie of ſweating water and blood, immediately before he was betrayed by curſed Iudas: <hi>Luke</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>And as for that other long ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce following the Preface: both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and after the conſecration: it repreſents to vs that admirable, &amp; prodigious quiet patience of this diuine &amp; innocent lambe, in all the cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:172208:115"/>
                     <hi>As a sheepe to ſlaughter shall he be led; &amp; as a lambe before his shearer, he shall be dumbe, and shall not open his mouth.</hi> This ſilence alſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to vs the great feare and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his Apoſtles, and Diſciples ſo greatly doubting, and ſtagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their Faith, from that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie tyme of his ſuffering, till the comming of the Holy Ghoſt; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which ſpace, they all kept priuate, and ſecret out of ſight.</p>
                  <p>The Prieſt praying ſecretly alſo at other tymes, and with a low voyce, puts vs in minde of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall priuate retreates, which this our moſt mercifull Lord, and gracious Redeemer IESVS, was accuſtomed to make in ſolitude ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from all companie, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpending whole nights in priuate, and feruent prayer.</p>
                  <p>And therefore you ſee that ſilence in this holy ſacrifice, is not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout pious Myſtery; nor is there anie other ceremonie in the Maſſe

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:172208:117"/>to pay him the like due tribute, by the practiſe of true vertue. For which end you haue in this Rule the ſeuerall exerciſes of ſuch choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce vertues, as may be conceiued moſt needfull for a vertuous ſoule, aſpiring to perfection.</p>
               <p>But before I ſpeake of anie in particular: it is to be ſuppoſed; that to make a right choyce of the moſt needfull and profitable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues for your practiſe: you muſt firſt conſider, wherein it is that you finde your chiefeſt frailty and weakeneſſe, on the one ſide; and ſecondly, what is your particular ſtate and profeſſion, on the other. For by this you will eaſily perceiue what vertue is moſt needfull for your preſent condition, or by what vice, you are chiefly in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to fall into ſinne, to the end to oppoſe it: which hauing diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, arme your ſelfe ſtrongly againſt that pernicious enemie, and bend all your whole force, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:172208:117"/>to the practiſe of that holy vertue which moſt oppoſeth it. As for example; if you finde that pride, Vaine glory, or Selfe-loue, and eſteeme, worke ſtrongly to gett poſſeſſion in your hart; oppoſe them vigorouſly by the diligent exerciſe of holy Humility, Abiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Contempt of your ſelfe. If Intemperance aſſault you, repell it by the practiſe of moderate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and by mortifying all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous curioſity in your diet. If Choller, and angry Paſſion shall ſurpriſe you, reſiſt it by Patience, and in the ſpirit of the mildenes and meekeneſſe of IESVS-CHRIST. If finally the dangerous vice of ſloath, and tediouſnes in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions, shall begin to faſten vpon your ſoule; call preſently to God with much feruour, that his holy grace may ſoone rëen kindle in you the ardent flame of true piety, and deuotion: but aboue all, be ſure neuer to let ſterility, or diſguſt in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:172208:118"/>your prayer, preuaile ſo farr with you, as to omit your vſuall, and accuſtomed deuotions: for patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and perſeuerance in your fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity vnto God, will not faile to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne you a bleſſing to your ful content and ioy.</p>
               <p>The like you muſt alſo obſerue in all the reſt: chooſing euer to preferr ſuch vertues as are moſt conformable to the obligation of your preſent condition; before ſuch as are moſt agreeable to your owne guſt and inclination: for our perfection (ſaith the B. Bishop of Geneua) conſiſts not in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of manie actions of Piety, but in the well doing of thoſe, to which our particular condition moſt oblidges vs, and which beſt ſuites with our preſent, and proper calling, or office.</p>

                  <head>A neceſſary aduertiſement for the true, ſolid, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table practiſe of anie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which we moſt deſire to obtayne.</head>
                  <p>BEfore I proceede to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of theſe following ſelect vertues, I conceiue it very requiſite firſt here to giue you in generall this neceſſary aduertiſment, for the profitable exerciſe of anie vertue whatſoeuer, and for the ſpeedy obtayning of that vertue which we moſt deſire: not doubting to aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re you, that the ill obſeruance of this rule, is the cauſe that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, after long exerciſe, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable acts of ſuch vertues as they moſt deſire to obtayne, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit verie little therein, or in anie true Chriſtian perfection.</p>
                  <p>Now the true reaſon hereof, is this; that each vertue hauing its
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:172208:119"/>proper ſpirit; (which is as the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, nature, and as the verie ſoule, or forme which giues life, and perfects the action) we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour not, as we ought, to frame in our ſoules (for the right prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of that vertue) ſuch due diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as the ſpirit of ſuch a vertue requires: and without which precedent diſpoſitions, the vertue is but meerely ſuperficiall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour. Wherefore we ought firſt to know, and well conſider with our ſelues, what is the ſpirit of ſuch a vertue, or wherein conſiſts the eſſence and true nature thereof, to the end that we may practiſe each vertue in its owne proper ſpirit, that is; to haue a true interior fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof; and that as we exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorly procure the action of the vertue; ſo we may practiſe in the interiour of our hart the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue it ſelfe; without which, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour nothing at all auailes: this interiour diſpoſition, being to all
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:172208:119"/>vertuous actions, as is the ſoule to the body, and as the roote from which the tree receiueth life and nourishment: yea it is as the verie bottome of the ſoule, the origine and life of all Chriſtian, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions.</p>
                  <p>This great truth will yet much more manifeſtly appeare, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ſeriouſly, how ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in vertue is made by the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exteriour practiſe thereof, if the interiour diſpoſition be wanting; as by this particular example, in the vertue of Humility, it may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appeare; and it will ſerue as a Rule for all the reſt. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne them by practiſe true Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, it is firſt neceſſary to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, in what that vertue conſiſts; to the end that when we would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the acts thereof, we may doe them in the interiour ſpirit of that vertue, and conformably to our knowledge thereof: otherwiſe how should we be able rightly to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:172208:120"/>practiſe a vertue which we doe not vnderſtand? or how can we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the acts thereof with anie fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or vnderſtanding of that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which we exerciſe?</p>
                  <p>And to make this cleare in our former example of Humility: we muſt firſt place our ſelues in the interiour diſpoſitions of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (and ſo likewiſe of all the reſt at which we ayme.) Then ſecondly we muſt make an eſteeme of God aboue all things, and thinke moſt meanely of our ſelues; and euen deſire our owne abiection, and contempt. And this is to lay a true ground, and right foundation in our ſoule; whereby, in her exerciſe of the exteriour act of Humility; shee ſtirrs vp in her hart a thought, and feeling of true Humility: and awakeing in her ſelfe the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both conuenient, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that particular vertue, shee accompanies the exteriour act of that vertue with an interiour
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:172208:120"/>eſteeme, and pure deſire of true Humility, and with a low and baſe eſteeme of herſelfe. And to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me an act of vertue in this manner; is to doe it in the ſpirit, and in the true and right diſpoſition of that vertue which we exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>And therefore whoſoeuer aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res to true perfection, muſt labour not only to produce the exteriour acts of that particular vertue at which he aymes; but alſo (and principally) he muſt endeuour to roote out of his hart the oppoſit inclination, and euill habite there vnto: for little would the exteriour act of Humility auaile; if volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Pride should remaine at the bottome of the hart. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer giues almes, with a hart poſſeſſed with Auarice, and obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſſe he catches only at an empty shadow, &amp; is deceiued by a meere body without a ſoule. Yea manie falſely conceiue themſelues greatly aduanced in vertue, by
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:172208:121"/>ſome new punctuality in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance of exteriour practiſes of piety propoſed to themſelues; who notwithſtanding after their long &amp; punctuall exerciſe therein, make verie ſmall aduancement in that holy perfection, at which they aymed: and the reaſon is manifeſt, and verie plaine; becauſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the interiour, and ſeek not the ſpirit of that vertue, for which they ſo labour but in vaine: and conſequently they doe not prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it with the neceſſary conditions which thoſe vertues doe require.</p>
                  <p>All this, now finally, both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and reaſon makes verie manifeſt: for how can we hope to obtayne the vertue of Humility (although we practiſe it by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand exteriour acts) we neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding what it is, nor hauing anie interiour feeling thereof: but rather quite contrary diſpoſitions to the ſame?</p>
                  <p>It is therefore moſt neceſſary
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:172208:121"/>to frame in our ſelues the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that vertue which we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: and before all things elſe, we muſt labour to forme our interiour, and rightly to direct it; for he who hath a defectiue bottome in his ſoule, or a vicious roote; he cannot produce good fruit from it: and therefore to exerciſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour acts of vertue, without the interiour diſpoſition required, would be but to catch at the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of vertue, and to remaine with a reality of the vice.</p>
                  <p>Thus much by way of needfull aduertiſement for the profitable practiſe, as well of theſe ſelected vertues here following, as alſo for all others whatſoeuer to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the vertuous ſoule, deſirous to make progreſſe in true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian perfection. And to proceed herein with due order; I muſt in firſt place propoſe that vertue which is the proper inſtrument to aduance all the reſt, and this is the vertue</p>

                  <p>AFter this generall aduertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo verie neceſſary for the practiſe of vertue; it will be now requiſit to ſpeake of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtrument required for the right exerciſe thereof: and this is the verie ſame which you finde aboue propoſed for the condition required to holy prayer; to witt, that moſt neceſſary vertue of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, without which (as it there appeares) that no prayer can be found in anie eminent degree; ſo likewiſe (and for the ſelfſame reaſon) no eminent pourchace can be made of anie other vertue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of Mortification; whereby renouncing our owne proper will and the naturall corrupt propenſion vnto flesh and blood, we take vp our Croſſe and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce thoſe contradictions of ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; diſpoſſeſſing our harts of that vnruly appetite for worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:172208:122"/>and by a courageous, and mortifiing act, we ſubdue our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Paſſions, which both blinde the eyes of our reaſon, and doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo much weaken the will. Which Paſſions and diſordinate affections being ſubdued; the vnderſtanding becomes truly enlightned to iudge what is good; and the will remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes freely diſengaiged to make choyce thereof.</p>
                  <p>By all which it appeares, that Mortification is the verie ground of Perfection, it diſpoſeth the way vnto vertue, &amp; is as the verie mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; needfull inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t required to put the ſame in execution. For as Reaſon, by originall ſinne had rebelled againſt God; ſo likewiſe (in due punishment) the ſenſuall appetite in vs rebelled euer ſince againſt Reaſon, and ſo mainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines our corrupt nature to euill; as vnleſſe it be ſtrongly kept in by the curbing bridle of Mortification (and that rightly managed alſo by
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:172208:123"/>Gods holy grace) we shall moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly be throwne downe by te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation into the deſtroying preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice of mortall ſinne: which to preuent, our ſureſt remedy (as S. Paul doth admonish vs) will be by <hi>alwayes bearing about in our body the Mortification of</hi> IESVS: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10. For it is a vertue as neceſſary to preſerue piety in our ſoules; as are the garden-sheeres to keepe the borders, and figures in due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which without often cutting, and clipping away of thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities which nature doth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually produce; no forme nor beauty would be left in the beſt planted knots in the garden. In fine this vertue of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as needfull for the planting of holy vertues in our ſoule; as is the hammer to frame the fashion which the workman is to introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce into the iron, now diſpoſed by the furnace, and made plyable therevnto: for be your minde neuer
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:172208:123"/>ſo well diſpoſed by holy prayer; yea though enflamed by diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, by ſpirituall lecture, by good counſell, or by anie other meanes whatſoeuer to the holy practiſe of Patience, or of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to Conformity, Prayer, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, or to the Exerciſe of anie other vertue whatſoeuer; we shall finde that Mortification is the needfull inſtrument, and meanes to put in execution thoſe good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, againſt which our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature will ſpurne, and make much reluctance: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe our good purpoſes be hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out by the ſtrong blowes of Mortificaion, all our former fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent good reſolutions will ſoone become as coold, ſtiff, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable, as is the verie iron it ſelfe when long detayned from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gé; nor shall we haue anie applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all to our former good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; which not being then labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out by the hammer of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,

                  <p>THeſe premiſſes now ſeruing for the more ſolid and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table exerciſe of true Chriſtian vertues; I will here out of manie, propoſe ſome ſpeciall and ſelect from amongſt all the reſt, &amp; which may iuſtly be conceiued moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit for the practiſe of a vertuous ſoule, aſpiring to holy perfection. Wherein to make the more ſolid building; we muſt euer begin with the foundation. Whence to raiſe the true building of vertue in our ſoules; we muſt firſt beginn with Humility, the true foundation of all other vertues; yea and the verie roote which giues life and luſter,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:172208:124"/>both to the flowre and fruit of all other vertues whatſoeuer; &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no act of the greateſt vertue can be either gratefull to God or aniewayſe auayleable to our ſoules. For as bleſſed <hi>S.</hi> Gregorie moſt truly aſſures vs; <hi>to practiſe other vertues without Humility, is but to caſt duſt into the ayre,</hi> Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity being the verie foundation, and conſeruer of all other vertues, as Pride is the ground of all ſinne: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. It diſpoſeth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the ſoule to receiue Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine grace; who reſiſting the proude, he giues grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>Iames</hi> 4. Yea it makes vs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Gods ſecret myſteries, which being hid from the worldly learned and wiſe; they are reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the humble. <hi>Math.</hi> 11. It doth pourchace perfect peace to our ſoules; excluding anger, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and diſcontent; all which proceeds originally but from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and ſelfe eſteeme. By all which
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:172208:125"/>we now plainly ſee, what great and happie fruit is to be reaped by the helpe and holy practiſe of true Humility: and therefore I thought it but neceſſary, here in the firſt place to propoſe this needfull Exerciſe; leaſt the blaſt of vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory might carry away, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue vs of the fruits of our beſt and holieſt practiſes. Which to preuent, this Exerciſe of Humility may ſerue as a poyſe to ballance them againſt that dangerous blaſt of Pride, and as a preſeruing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote from the peſtiferous ayre of vaine-glory, which deſtroyes all vertue in the verie budd, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefuls't flower. And therefore no vertue is more ſeriouſly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs by our B. Sauiour himſelfe (both by his practiſe, and doctrine) then is this which he ſo expreſly commandes vs to learne of him who is <hi>milde and humble of hart. Math.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>And although vnto humaine
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:172208:125"/>deceiued ſight this vertue may ſeeme but poore, baſe, and verie deſpicable; yet by God and his bleſſed Saints it is highly eſteemed, and may well be reſembled to the cyphers in numbring; which though nothing of themſelues, yet placed behinde an vnity they make tenn; hundreds behinde two; thowſands behinde three, and ſo forward in proportion. In like manner Humility in it ſelfe, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gh but little eſteemed, yet it is that which giues the true valew to all other vertues; yea it is the verre Rule, and meaſure of all true ſanctity it ſelfe; for who is ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely humble, is truly holy; and who is moſt humble, he is alſo moſt holy; for accordingly as one humbles himſelfe; ſo God doth exalte him, and he puts downe the proude. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.11.</p>
                  <p>Fot this vertue it was that God raiſed S. Antonie. S. Benet. S. Maur. S. Francis, and others to be
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:172208:126"/>Founders of ſo manie holy Orders of religious perſons in his Church; who though moſt eminent in all Perfection and ſanctity; yet their Humility was ſo great, as they durſt neuer admit to vndertake that (more then Angelicall) heigh ſtate of Prieſtly function; which notwithſtanding now (to the great ſcandall of the Church) is by ſuch ſinfull preſumption ſought for by ſo manie vnfitt, and moſt vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary perſons.</p>
                  <p>Neither haue weomen been wanting in this kinde to giue moſt rare examples of profound Humility; as doth well appeare in that great ſeruant of God Siſter Mary of the Incarnation, of noble birth; who was ſo verie humble, as notwithſtanding that shee was Foundreſſe of the holy Order of the Carmelites in France; yet would shee neuer be of the Quire, but alwayes continued a lay-ſiſter, and a ſeruant to all the reſt. S. Francis
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:172208:126"/>was alſo truly humble of hart, which made him with ſuch feeling ſenſe to eſteeme himſelfe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of ſinners; becauſe he thought himſelfe aboue all others to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond the worſt vnto the graces which God had beſtowed vpon him. This is that true Humility, which hath no other will, but the will of God; to which it renders vs like to the ſtatue in the ſculpters hands, to be hewed, and fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to his diuine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without diſquiet, or reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: for this Humility of hart, is the inſeparable twinn of all ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and peace (ſaith that great Maiſter of all ſweet deuotion, Sales the holy Bishop of Geneua) but I meane not (ſaith he) a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall rainging of words, or geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of kiſſing the ground, or lowly inclinations; they being donn (as it often doth arriue) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the inward ſenſe of our owne abiection; for ſuch are but vaine

                  <p>This true Humility of hart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in the knowing only, and profeſſing our owne great vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, and miſery; but much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in louing, ſeekeing, and exerciſing of this our baſeneſſe, and abiection; and in deſiring to be ſo eſteemed by others, as we doe iudge our ſelues truly to bee, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and contemptible; yea yet further; to be alſo content (as ſuch) to be contemned, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by all: for true Humility of hart doth loue this humiliation, and reproach, and all elſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer which may truly vilifie, and abaſe vs. Firſt by reaſon of the knowledge which it hath of that our originall, and interiour ſource,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:172208:127"/>and corrupted ſpring whence all our ſinne and wickedneſſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des; and ſecondly in Imitation of IESVS-CHRIST, who made choyce of all manner of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and reproach; thereby to honour his heauenly Father, and to ſatisfie for our exorbitant pride and grieuous ſinne: which is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue aboundantly ſufficient to ſtirr vs vp to all feruent imitation, for ſo diuine an exemples ſake.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond practiſe of this holy vertue; which I now alſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commende vnto you, is in not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly louing humiliations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; but alſo in hating, and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vanity of all greatnes, and ſplendor; yea the verie deſire of all humaine praiſe, and eſteeme.

                  <p>THis holy Conformity is to the precedent great vertue of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, but as a linke of the ſame chaine, and the verie true ſequele
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:172208:128"/>of that bleſſed vertue; they being both united in that ſuperiour hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py tye of the loue of God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this precious chavneſs compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the continued linkes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni other great vertues, and vnites vs moſt happily vnto God himſelfe. In fine from true Humility (as from a moſt precious roote) ſprings fourth this faire and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flower of vertuous Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: for by an humble, and true abiect contempt of our ſelues, our owne will becomes eaſily confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, not only to the will of God, but alſo for his ſake, we ſubmit and ſubiect our ſelues, euen to the meaneſt creature aliue.</p>
                  <p>Now in the faithfull practiſe of this heroique vertue conſiſts that true Chriſtian Perfection, which IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST hath not only taught vs by word daily to pray, that <hi>his will be done in Earth, at it is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;</hi> But he confirmed alſo the ſame by his owne example, telling
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:172208:129"/>vs: that he came downe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, not to doe his owne will, but the will of his Father who ſent him. <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> 6. and this he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as his nourishing food: <hi>Math.</hi> 11. Yea and it is moſt worthy of obſeruing; that from the tyme of his returne with the ſacred Virgin and S. Ioſeph from his diuine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning with the Doctors in the Temple at Hieruſalem (as if he had come downe from Heauen for no other deſigne, then to shew obedience and Conformity vnto his heauenly Fathers will, in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being ſubiect vnto his Parents pleaſure) he was ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punctuall in all dutifull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them; as the holy Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt recompts to vs no other of of his diuine actions, during the farr greater part of all his tyme, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hereupon earth amongſt vs; but only that he Was obedient <hi>and ſubiect to them:</hi> the perfect perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of which holy Conformity
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:172208:129"/>vnto his heauenly Fathers will, he finally ſealed; by rendring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto that bitter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull death vpon the Croſſe. In imitation of which diuine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; we muſt be in all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo reſigned to Gods holy will, as is the clay in the potters hands, which chooſeth not its owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, or forme; but is plyable and obedient to that which the workeman pleaſeth to ordayne it vnto: for thereby you will obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne a moſt happie peace to your minde, and euen begin to enioy a perfect Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes there is nothing will happen, which can depriue vs of true content and conſolation; in which conſiſts the chiefeſt feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Gods heigheſt fauorits in this world; who though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from laborious, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full temptations, nor from infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and great corporall ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings: yet by the helpe of this
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:172208:130"/>holy Conformity, whatſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls them, they preſerue their ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, &amp; true interiour ioy: becauſe there whole content, and pleaſure is in the accomplishment of the will of God, which makes all euents whatſoeuer to be gratefull to them, though neuer ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and diſpleaſing to flesh and blood: they knowing that nothing can befall them, but by his diuine order and will; whoſe louing and carefull Prouidence hath diſpoſed of all things for our greateſt good; what inſtruments, and ſecond cauſes ſoeuer he shall pleaſe to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vſe of for effecting the ſame: yea no ſterility in prayer, nor the want of all ſenſible deuotion, and comfort therein, will diſquiet a well ſetled ſoule in this vertuous practiſe of Conformity, whereas, who neglect the ſame; if they but faile to obtayne what they craue by theire prayers; they leaue of with diſguſt, and are greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:172208:130"/>for failing of the end, and deſire of their owne proper ſatisfaction; Which oftentymes preuailes ſo verie much with them; as they are ſtrongly tempted, and ſometymes ouercome ſo farr, as to abandon their praiers and other vertuous Exerciſes; which is the greateſt victory theyr mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie can deſire to obtayne.</p>
                  <p>And for theſe good reaſons it was that the ancient holy Fathers did greatly apply themſelues to this important ſtudie, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practiſe of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that true reſignation is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in deeds, and not in words; and in takeing all things as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the hand of God; by which vertuous Exerciſe, their greateſt aduerſities were made moſt pleaſing contents; and their life become celeſtiall vpon Earth; yea finally, <hi>to liue or to dye</hi> is all one and <hi>the ſelfe ſame thing</hi> (ſaith S. Auguſtin) <hi>when our will is truly
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:172208:131"/>vnited to the will of God;</hi> in who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſight we are, and vpon whom our being depending, we ought wholy to reſigne our ſelues to him; with all which we can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe or ſuffer; in body or in ſoule in ſame, frends, or externall goods, for tyme, or for Eternity; with a perfect reſignation to his diuine and holy pleaſure; yea his granting or denying our requeſt, muſt be to vs indifferent; for we ayming but at the glory of God, and our owne, ſoules greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines (both which he knowing farr better then our ſelues) we muſt reſt ioyfully content with his diuine will, though neuer ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our owne deſire; who know not oftentymes what we aske: and therefore with great loue and mercy it is, that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God denies our petition (ſaith S. Auguſtin) that he may doe vs a more mercifull fauour; nor yet ought we ſo much to reioyce for
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:172208:131"/>obtayning what we deſire, as that it is the will of God which is done thereby: for by this vnion, and Conformity with Gods bleſſed will, we doe moſt truly reſtifie our loue, and by it we doe our trueſt honour and homage to him: and to our ſelues we alſo pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance that true content, and moſt happie repoſe, which is only to be found in a ſoule thus truly ſubiect vnto Gods holy will: for <hi>who is he that reſiſts it, and findeth peace</hi> (ſaith Iob. 9.) but <hi>be ſubiect to him and thou art ſecure to enioy it. c.</hi> 22. Finally by the practiſe of this holy Conformity to the diuine will and pleaſure of God, how euer our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires shall ſucceed, yet our hart will enioy a moſt happie and quiet peace; we acknowledging God to be the ſoueraign Lord of all; and vnderſtanding beſt what moſt conduceth to his owne glory, and to our ſoules eternall health.</p>

                  <head>The fourth Exerciſe of this Rule; which is for the practiſe of Patience.</head>
                  <p>THe great connexion of this holy vertue with the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is moſt apparent; for where there is true Humility of hart, and an entire conformity to the will of God, there doubtleſſe Patience cannot be wanting to ſuffer with all cheerefull alacrity what Croſſe or tribulation ſoeuer the Diuine Prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce shall be pleaſed to orday ne. This makes vp a ſtrong chayne of theſe three holy linkes of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vertue; whereby all our vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and diſordered paſſions may be faſt bound in due ſubiection, both to true reaſon, and pietie.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeake now here of the proper fruits of holy Patience in particular (as before I haue of the other two) it may be firſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that patience is as a needfull
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:172208:132"/>barr; and shuts vp the dore againſt manie ſinnes; for by moderating the griefe and great trouble of minde; it quencheth hatred, and preuents both anger, and deſire of reuenge; by which are let in a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of pernicious vices; and with much reaſon it is ſaid by S. Gregory; to be the wide gate to let in the great ſinnes of rancor, and wrath, of iniuries, impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, maledictions, blaſphemies, indignations, murthers, and the like greate euills, which are vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harboured in a hart oppreſſed with impatience, bitterneſſe, and griefe: all which being firſt taken away by the holy vertue of patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, the ſoule is left in much quiet, and is alſo thereby enabled to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce true vertuous and perfect operations. And for this reſpect, ſome (not vnfitly) call Patience the preſeruer of vertues; for the ſame being diſquieted, vertue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rightly exerciſe her functions;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:172208:133"/>no nor doe any thing well; and therefore shee hath great need of Patience to keepe Reaſon free, and the minde exempt from all Paſſion; for hereby we are diſpoſed to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in quiet peace, all ſuch afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as shall befall vs, and to take them in good parte.</p>
                  <p>It alſo greatly moderates that hurtfull paſſion of ſorrow, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, an humour aboue all the reſt exceeding dangerous, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full both to body and ſoule; vnleſſe they be defended by that ſtrong buckler of Patience from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall great oppreſſions of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and dangerous Paſſion. And therefore though all vertues be verie requiſite; yet Patience is moſt abſolutely neceſſary for our complying with the will of God, and for ſauing our ſoules; as the Apoſtle tells vs <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. and the reaſon is; for that our life is ſo replenished with miſeries, that without this needfull defence of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:172208:133"/>holy Patience, we shall neuer ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne the crowne of victory: but <hi>in your patience you shall poſſeſſe your ſoules; Luke</hi> 21. As that holy man well vnderſtood, who being much vrged to gett ſome certaine rude perſons to be ſeuerely punished for hauing mocked and much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him; he anſwered with a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and pleaſant countenance: <hi>no, no, let them doe ſo ſtill to me</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for they doe but helpe me to get Heauen by the practiſe of holy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi> This was a vertuous, and true humble man; for who is humble, is vndoubtedly patient; becauſe he eſteemes himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of the euill which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth; yea and of farr greater alſo. And if we would but ſearch out the true cauſe of our impatience, and aſcende but to the ſource, and true origin, we should finde that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from meere pride, and ſelfe eſteeme; and this made the holy Bishop of Geneua to aduiſe vs,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:172208:134"/>that we should complaine the leaſt we could of wrongs; <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith this excellent man (<hi>for the moſt part it is verte true; that who complains, doth ſinne</hi> (he meanes for want of Patience, and Humility; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re theſe vertues are found, there is no complaint, neither for ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, loſſe, nor iniury: for their Patience is inuincible in all ſortes of afflictions; and Humility iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all to be but anſwerable to their deſert; they rather reioyce to pay here their debt, hoping to haue thereby the leſſe accompt for the future. And certainly much truer perfection there is in ſuffering cheerefully our croſſes and contradictions for the loue of God, and with a conformable hart to his bleſſed will in the tyme of our temporall or ſpirituall afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then in the moſt ſenſible comforts of deuotion, by either raptures, or extaſies in the tyme of proſperity and conſolation. And
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:172208:134"/>to this purpoſe, that holy Father and learned Doctor of the Church great S. Gregory ſaith; that he fare preferrs the vertue of a patient man, before that of working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: and his ground for it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; becauſe it is the verie fruit it ſelfe of the heigheſt vertue, <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which (ſaith S. Paul. <hi>cor.</hi> 13.) <hi>it patient, is benigne; Charity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieth not &amp;c. is not prouoked to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thinketh not euill: &amp;c. Jt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth all things,</hi> and that in good parte for the loue of God. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine loue makes the practiſe of Patience both eaſie and verie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: <hi>gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmity, that the power of God may dwell in me. For the which cauſe</hi> (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle) <hi>I pleaſe myſelfe in infirmities, in contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, in neceſſities, in perſecution, in diſtreſſes for</hi> CHRIST. Thus bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed S. <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Shewing vs how Patience for the loue of God makes all ſufferings and afflictions
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:172208:135"/>whatſoeuer to be the true obiects of great comfort and ioy.</p>
                  <p>All this is clearely verifi'd in the life of that illuſtrious Virgin bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saint Margaret daughter to the King of Hungary, and a true mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of all religious perfection; who grounding the vertue of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience vpon true Humility; and that, vpon the loue of God; this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Virgin, and moſt humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of IESVS-CHRIST did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten weepe, &amp; was moſt troubled in her minde; becauſe shee found no practiſe for the vertue of Patience, wherein notwithſtanding shee well perceiued her religious Siſters to be frequently exerciſed by ſtrong contradictions to flesh and blood; whereas shee found herſelfe inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be that wayes mortifi'd. And the cauſe is verie manifeſt; for who deſires nothing, but purely the will of God, is alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with whatſoeuer shall happen.</p>
                  <p>But yet for the more facilitating
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:172208:135"/>this practiſe of holy Patience as well againſt contempt and iniuries, as in all other croſſes and troubel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome accidents which may befall vs; I muſt here recommend to your ſerious conſideration theſe enſuing motiues, and conuincing reaſons for that end.</p>
                  <p>Firſt that whatſoeuer is in this world moſt diſpleaſing and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, is nothing to a true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and generous hart; which rather is glad of occaſions for ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, thereby to giue proofe of his foundation in vertue, and of fidelity to his heauenly Captaine IESVS-CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Secondly conſider that theſe troubles doe not happen to vs, but by the particular Prouidence of God, for his glory, and our greater good; and that he is a ſpectator how we play our partes for that crowne, which is only to be got by lawfull fight. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly conſider that there is
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:172208:136"/>nothing in this world to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which our ſinnes haue not iuſtly deſerued; and that all put togeather which can be inflicted vpon vs in this world, is but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, in compariſon of the paines of Hell, or Purgatory; which yet by patient ſufferance here; may be auoyded; &amp; euerlaſting glory gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Looke not therefore with an angry hart vpon ſuch as shall cauſe you anie trouble, or paine; but much rather eſteeme them (as truly they are) thoſe who doe you the trueſt good; and who afford you but happie occaſion to make proofe of your Chriſtian courage, of your ſolidity in vertue, and of your fidelity to God; who vſeth theſe temporall afflictions but as inſtrumentall meanes, thereby to procure you that great happineſſe which you gaine by thoſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to practiſe holy Patience; and is (ſaith S. Iames <hi>ch.</hi> 1,) <hi>a per fect worke: for in your Patience you shall poſſeſſe your ſoules: Luke.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:172208:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Finally endeauour by a ſerious and frequent contemplation of the great vncertainty, and little worth of all worldly affaires, to gaine an indifferency to all humaine caſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; they all hapning by Gods ſpeciall order and prouidence; and therefore, moſt vndoubtedly, for our greater good: and why then should we be troubled, it being Gods bleſſed pleaſure, which we ought moſt promptly to conforme our ſelues in all: yea it ought to be a comfort and great content to vs; (ſaith S. Greg.) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anie thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth which croſſeth our owne deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, conſidering that ſo it is orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him, who doth nothing, but what is moſt iuſt and good.</p>
                  <p>Raiſe therefore your ſoule with cheerefull gratitude to adore his hidden iudgments in all croſſe euents, which he permits for your greater good. Perſeuer with peace and tranquility of minde; <hi>for he hath done all things well. Gen.</hi> 7. And
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:172208:137"/>what cauſe then can you haue to be troubled; vnleſſe you miſtruſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his power, or his goodneſſe; which yet can neuer faile.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I haue ſpoke rather of the Theory of true Patience, and but as concerning it in generall. It now remaines that I alſo treate of the needfull practiſe of it more in particular, and in the chiefe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions wherein nature findes moſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance in the holy Exerciſe of this vſefull vertue.

                  <p>YOu may now well perceiue by the former parte of this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the great goodneſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant fruit of this holy plant of Patience; the knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I doubt not, but will giue you a deſire to make ſtore of ſo needfull a prouiſion, by the daily and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall occaſions which will not be
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:172208:137"/>wanting, whereby you may reape ſo great profit to your ſoule. But to auoyde prolixity in ſo copious a ſubiect; I haue thought beſt to make choyce, and here princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to propoſe to you the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Exerciſe of this great vertue in the two aboue named occaſions; as being the hardeſt, and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to our corrupt and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious nature: for by well maiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them; we shall finde the reſt but verie weake, and eaſie to be ouercome.</p>
                  <p>And now firſt to shew that we ought to ſuffer tribulation with content and ioy; I will only make choyce of ſome few good reaſons out of manie, which are ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince this truth; &amp; may alſo ſerue for ſtrong motiues to induce vs to the meritorious practiſe of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the croſſe encounters of this world, with a willing cheerefullnes, for the loue of God.</p>
                  <p>The firſt reaſon for this truth
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:172208:138"/>shall be fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our diuine Rule &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype CHRIST IESVS himſelfe; who not by his diuine &amp; ſacred actions here vpon Earth no, nor by his ſo feruent &amp; aſſiduous prayer; nor yet by his preaching, or working of ſo manie miracles, did cuerren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Eternall Father ſo great honour and glory, as he did by his painefull death and Paſſion. From whence it doth playnely follow, and conuince in all good reaſon; that we are not able by anie other meanes ſo heighly to honour, and glorifie God, as by a willing and cheerefull ſufferance of our afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in vnion and imitation of this our diuine example, and in true conformity to Gods bleſſed will and all diſpoſing Proudience. when therefore he shall vouchſafe to try vs by anie corporall tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by the loſſe of goods, by priuation of frends, or of what elſe ſoeuer moſt deare to vs; we muſt accept thereof; as an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion expreſly ordayned by his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:172208:138"/>Prouidence, whereby we may render to him due homage &amp; honour; conceiuing alſo that he puts vs to ſuch bodily tryall, but as a ſweet perfume into the fire; to the end that by a good odour of vertuous Patience, we may giue both good example to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and occaſion alſo for them to glorifie our heauenly Father by ſeeing ſo cheerefull and humble an acceptation of it for his loue: <hi>for benefitts are willingly receiued by all</hi> (ſaith the holy Bishop of Geneua) <hi>but to receiue willingly afflictions, that belongs only to perfect loue, which loues them ſo much the more, becauſe they are not to be loued, but only in reſpect of the hand which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon which ought to make all ſufferings verie wellcome to vs; is, for that Heauen, and eternall happines is bought by them: yea this price it coſt the ſonne of God himſelfe, before he
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:172208:139"/>could enter into his glory (though heire apparent vnto the ſame <hi>Act.</hi> 17.) And can we then preſume to pourchace this happie inheritance of that heauenly Father at a lower rate, then he sould it to his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and deareſt ſonne, who both ſuffered; yea and gaue his deareſt life for it. O no, the ſeruill ſlaue muſt not expect to be prefer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſoueraigne Lord: it is an exceſſiue fauour to be admitted to beare the ſame yoke with him. All which but duely conſidered, might well make vs aſshamed to feare anie ſufferings, or to fly from anie croſſe; ſeeing that we profeſſe our ſelues to be diſciples of a crucified God: for is it aniewiſe beſeeming the member of a heade crowned with sharpe piercing thornes, to be ſo delicate, as to fly from all paine or ſuffering, which is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and taxed price of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe?</p>
                  <p>And therefore, ſeeing (as the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:172208:139"/>aboue named holy Bishop of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua ſaith) <hi>that it is but in vaine to expect to be glorifi'd with</hi> IESVS <hi>in Heauen, vnleſſe we be firſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd with</hi> IESVS <hi>here vpon Earth;</hi> let vs moſt willingly embrace his holy croſſe, and not by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion only, as Simon the Cyrenean did; but much rather with S. Paul; let it be farr from vs to glory in anie thing ſo much, as in this moſt honorable liuery of our diuine Captaine, the Croſſe and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of IESVS-CHRIST: <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. Yea reaſon doth conuince vs, that the temporall punishment is moſt hapie, whereby we eſcape an eternall: &amp; ſuch as are here exempt from them, may iuſtly feare, leaſt their farr greater punishment be but reſerued to an other world; there being moſt aſſuredly no other way but this to Paradiſe for the children of God, but firſt to paſſe through this fearefull red ſea of tribulation, before they can
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:172208:140"/>hope to enter into that happie land of promiſſe.</p>
                  <p>The third reaſon, which may comprehende all the reſt; and is a verie ſtrong motiue for vs to ſuffer with willing alacrity all manner of aduerſity is; that God the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Author of nature hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained all the croſſes &amp; afflictions which befall vs, for the due pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of our ſinfull rebellion, and diſobedience; for he had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced man in a moſt happie ſtate in the terreſtriall Paradiſe of pleaſure and content; vntill he forfeited that happineſſe by curſed ſinne; and had made himſelfe, and all his poſterity miſerable thereby for all Eternity; had not Gods infinit great loue and mercy to men (more then to Angels) accepted for his ſatisfaction a temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment from vs, in the vertue and merits of the death and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his onely deare ſonne IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS-CHRIST; for whoſe ſake,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:172208:140"/>he vouchſafed to accept of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to his diuine iuſtice, by theſe preſent afflictions which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe here impoſeth vpon vs for that end; and is euer the chiefe author thereof, what other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſoeuer he may pleaſe to vſe, as inſtruments for the execution of theſe his fatherly corrections; which are alſo diſpoſed by him for our greateſt good.</p>
                  <p>This was acknowledged by holy Iob, when after all the great and manie miſchiefes which the Diuell had done him, in ruining his houſes and children by tempeſt; in robbing his cattell, and killing his ſeruants by theeues, in deſtroying his goods by fire: and finally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing couered his body with manie ſmarting ſoares, and loathſome vlcers; yet all this, that holy man did attribute to none but to God himſelfe, and ſaid, <hi>our Lord gaue, and our Lord hath taken away, as it hath pleaſed our Lord, ſo it is done Iob.</hi> 1 21.</p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:172208:141"/>
                  <p>Chaſte Ioſeph doth as plainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vs the verie ſame. When his brethren being much affraied for hauing ſo grieuouſly abuſed him; he comforted them ſaying: <hi>be not affraid, neither let it ſeeme to you a hard caſe that you did ſell me into theſe countries: for God ſent me befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re you into Egipt for your preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Gen.</hi> 43.</p>
                  <p>And finally to alleage one more for all: did not our bleſſed Sauiour himſelfe ſay: <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. <hi>the chalice which my Father hath giuen to me, shall not I drinke it?</hi> Here you ſee plainly that he calles it not the treaſon of Iudas; nor the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iewes, Scribes, or Phariſees, but <hi>the chalice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> for all afflictions come from him, and are ſent by his eternall order to vs for our good. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore this being beleeued by a Chriſtian (as it ought) how can we be troubled at the afflictions, and croſſes which are ſent from ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:172208:141"/>ſo prudent, and ſo good a Father, as moſt milde and fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable executioners of his diuine iuſtice, and as moſt wholeſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from his skilfull and louing Phiſition, to cure the ſinfull ſurfer of his ſoule?</p>
                  <p>Finally afflictions, are to vs, but as bitter aloes which the nource puts to her breaſtes, thereby wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the child, to make it willing to come home to his owne true mother: for God by affliction makes vs to diſlike this world, our nource, and to looke home vnto him, our only true and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Parent.</p>
                  <p>Manie more motiues might be alleaged for vs to embrace afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a willing minde; but it may ſuffice to remember that it is the beſt token of Gods diuine loue to vs and the verie badge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath euer honored and cloathed his deareſt frends: to the good he ſends it for the increaſe of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:172208:142"/>their merit; and to the bad, for their conuerſion. In fine he impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes it vnto all, as the meanes for their eternall happineſſe; and therefore it ought to be receiued by all, with a cheerefull and willing hart.</p>
                  <p>But me thinkes I heare you to complaine, as King Dauid did; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 54.13. that your greateſt wrongs, are from your neareſt frends; and therefore much more greeuous, then would they be from a profeſſed enemie. I doe ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily beleeue you: but yet you muſt remember that vngratefull Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon was much nearer to his ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly louing Father Dauid (the true figure herein of IESVS-CHRIST) whom he moſt vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefully, &amp; vngraciouſly labored to depriue, not only of his kingdome and crowne, but alſo moſt fiercely purſued him for his verie life; as we likewiſe ſee thoſe vngratefull Iewes to haue done the like to IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS-CHRIST
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:172208:142"/>himſelfe, whom Dauid did but repreſent. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you hauing ſuch preſidents for this your ſufferance; you ought rather to eſteeme it a verie great honour, to beare your little share with them.</p>
                  <p>You may yet peraduenture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: that your chiefe repugnance, and greateſt difficulty in ſuffering theſe Croſſes with true patience, is becauſe you deſerued no ill from their hands; nor had done them anie wrong, who thus cruelly, and moſt vnkindely haue perſecuted you. But neither is this a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for your impatience; but is rather to be regarded, as the glory of your cauſe: for had you firſt offended them by anie wrong or iniury; your ſufferance had been but a iuſt punishment of your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; whereas you being inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; your patient ſufferance will gaine you an incomparable aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; for nothing doth ſo much
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:172208:143"/>extoll innocency, as iniuſtice: and though it be an oppreſſion; yet (if it bee truly looked vpon) it is but a pledge from Gods owne proper hand, and as a token of his loue, which therefore ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with all cheerefull alacrity.</p>
                  <p>But he depriues me of my main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance (ſay you) and will bring me to much want, and neceſſity. This toucheth indeed verie neere, and to the quick: yet take great heed that you doe not herein the parte of a peeuish and angry child from whome if the louing Mother shall take but ſome hurtfull bable out of the one hand, it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently throw downe the good meate which it hath in the other; and in a peeuish pett, it will ſtamp and ſtarue for reuenge: but the childe of God muſt not intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately grieue, nor ſo diſquiet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the loſſe of what ſo louing a Father shall take from him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately himſelfe, or by
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:172208:143"/>a frend, or a foe; as that for the loſſe of ſome parte of his meanes, he should there vpon, by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience depriue himſelfe of the content which he might fuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently haue taken in the reſt which he ſtill enioyes. No we ought much rather to looke downe vpon the innumerable multitude of thoſe who remaine in a farr mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fortune below vs, and who would accompt themſelues excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding happie, and obleiged to great gratitude, should they enioy but ſome ſmall parte of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder; and yet perhaps deſerue it much better then wee, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that it is ſent vs from that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hand, which diſpoſeth all for our beſt aduantage, if we with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity but render our ſelues cheerefully to his diuine will; for if he depriue vs here of our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall content, and happineſſe, we may reſt aſſured that he hath allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; reſerues for vs thoſe others
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:172208:144"/>infinitly excelling them, and to be eternall in Heauen; if through our owne willfull fault, we be not the vnhappie hinderance of them our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>This I truſt will now be aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to make large ſcope for your owne better refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions vpon this fruitfull ſubiect; whereby to picke moſt pleaſant ſweet roſes of Conformity, from theſe sharpe pricking thornes of your manie ſufferings, towards the compoſing of a glorious crowne (I hope) for your deareſt ſoule.</p>
                  <p>But yet for the richer adorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this your happy crowne: I muſt further recommend to you the interlacing it with theſe the richeſt iewels of Charity, which are likewiſe to be gathered in the garden of a vertuous ſoule, by each act of the loue of our enemie, produced originally from the true Ioue of God, and are the pureſt, &amp; moſt eleuated acts of Charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

                  <p>And that the weighty impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this ſo expreſſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand might the better appeare; the Angelicall Doctor S. Tho. diuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares it, aſſuring vs that tho true loue of our Enemie is the moſt pure, the moſt diuine, and the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſt act of holy Charity which can be performed by man. This great truth is not auouched with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the proofe of moſt euident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for there is nothing that man can doe which appeareth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly to be done by him ſo pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the loue of God, as to loue his greateſt Enemie: for you may loue God in deſire of your owne good, and to gaine Heauen the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby; you may alſo (and moſt vſually) loue your frend, becauſe he is your frend, or for his good humour, and ſympathy; or for ſome pleaſing qualitie, or for profit, honout, or the like which may be reaped by his conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:172208:146"/>In fine you may loue an other in reſpect of ſome content, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; and all this is but meerely for your owne commodity, as both Turkes, and barbarous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans doe; yea euen brute beaſtes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues can loue in ſuch a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner.</p>

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:172208:148"/>to reforme our liues.</p>
                  <p>We pay wages to Maiſters, and Gouernours; and yet none are ſo carefully obſeruant to let vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our miſde meanours, as are our greateſt Enemies, and that alſo <hi>gratis,</hi> without pay. He boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly tells vs true, when our frend dares not ſpeake; and he ſerues vs as a needfull curbe by publishing our vice, and will plainly aduertiſe vs if we goe amiſſe: nor dare we doe ill in his ſight: whereas a frend ſeldome preuents anie thing of all this great harme; but rather (&amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie frequently) he prooues a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, &amp; great cauſe of our doing ill.</p>
                  <p>When a Frend extolls, and highly prayſeth vs, our Enemie (much more for our good) doth abaſe, and decryes vs downe, leaſt we should grow proud and inſolent.

                  <p>If Enemies were not neceſſary for our good, God would not permit them; but they are exceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the good, for their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of holy Patience, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues; for if the Church had not had Tyrants, Heauen would not haue had thoſe glorious Martyrs; and were there no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we should not ſee ſo manie good and holy men: yea dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth plainly manifeſt the great good which is reaped by Enemies: for auoyding of whoſe murmurations and detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we are made much more wary, and diligent in all our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heaueour and actions: yea we muſt regarde them as the Miniſters of Almighty God, and as true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motours of our ſaluation; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they well deſerue our loue,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:172208:149"/>aſwell as great compaſſion alſo, conſidering what great harme they frequently doe themſelues, by profiting vs. And ſuch as find ſo great a difficulty to loue an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, may well conceiue it a much more harder thing to endure the eternall flames of Hell; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled we are to chooſe one of the two; the beloued Apoſtle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring vs <hi>that who loueth not, is guilty of death: Iohn.</hi> 3. He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that death which is eternall: but now vndoubtedly he chooſeth verie ill, who will rather be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for euer; then loue his Enemie whom vnder paine of eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment he is commanded to loue: and that, <hi>not in word, nor in tongue; but really indeed, and treuth,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle. <hi>Epiſ.</hi> 1.3. For true Charity is a burning fire, actiue and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in all neceſſary ſeruices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbour; doing good for euill with a cordiall and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:172208:149"/>affability for the loue of God; for what meaſure we shall vſe to our neighbour herein, the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame will God vſe vnto vs. <hi>Math.</hi> 7. And therefore who will not pardon their Enemies; ſuch by ſaying their <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and praying God <hi>to forgiue them, as they forgiue thoſe who haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them;</hi> they doe not pray; but rather dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de a moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy curſe, &amp; malediction vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: for they expreſly, &amp; in true effect demand that God should not forgiue them, like as they forgiue not thoſe who haue offended them. Doe you therefore your ſelfe that firſt to your neighbour; which you deſire that God should doe for you: <hi>for foe shall my heauenly Father doe to you, if you forgiue not euerie one his brother from your hartes,</hi> ſaith IESVS-CHRIST, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. And it is alſo moſt euident that all iniuries whatſoeuer which can be done them by others, are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſmall, in compariſon of that
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:172208:150"/>great hurt which they doe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, in killing their owne ſoule by that wicked ſinne of hatred and reuenge: whereby they beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me like vnto him, who to teare his enemies garment, he pierceth his owne body with a mortall wound; for the wrong from an Enemie concernes but the body only, or our goods, or good name; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and vnlawfull reuenge is that which killeth the ſoule, by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it of the grace of God: and moreouer it obleiges vs yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to aske pardon, to confeſſe, to doe pennance for it; and finally to reconcile our ſelues with whom we were angry: in all which, there is farr more difficulty, then had been at the firſt, in ſuppreſſing our anger; by caſting it ſpeedily from our thoughts, as we doe ſpareles of fire which fall vpon our cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes; or by an act of humble pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, conſeruing thereby our ſelues in true charity and quiet peace.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Our verie entrance into this world doth well prognoſticate all our future ſucceſſe therein; who no ſooner borne, but alſo bound both hand and foot, and toſſed too and fro in a cradle, preſaging well thereby the ſeruitude, and reſtleſſe diſquiet of the ſucceeding life of Man; wherein his childhood paſſeth in folly, in feare of correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in ignorance: his youth is rash, paſſionate, and voluptuous: his manhood is ſubiect to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the care of a wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and familie; from whence proceeds ſolicitude, and affliction:
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:172208:152"/>and laſtly commeth creeping ould age ſtealing ſuddainly vpon vs, whereby we receiue manie incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wounds, by decay of our ſenſes, &amp; chief powers of our ſoule, &amp; our ſtrenght falling vs, our hands beginn to tremble, our ſpiritts grow faint, our ſtomakes corrupt, our leggs become gowty: our teeth dropp away: and thus we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed all the dayes of our life with griefe, care, and calamity, and yet our death muſt alſo end in paine and exceeding horrour.</p>
                  <p>All which now being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; and due reflection made vpon our great abiection, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitt humaine miſeries: which wayes can we caſt our eyes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ground our ſelfe eſteeme, or pride? Yea much rather haue we not great cauſe to iudge that no contempt can be ſo great as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue; and yet our happineſſe in this ſurpaſſeth farr all other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall creatures; that by enduring
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:172208:152"/>with vertuous Patience this ſmall te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall contempt; we may auoyde the eternall paines which our ſinnes haue moſt iuſtly deſerued: and at the ſelfeſame inſtant alſo that we endure here this ſmall wordly deſpiſe; God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells will honour and eſteeme vs in Heauen for the ſame. Deſpiſe therefore with a true generous cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all momentary vaine glory, &amp; the deceiptfull eſteeme of men; ſeeing that by your vertuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing them, you gaine that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true honour and glory in the ſight of God, which only is right worthy of eſteeme.</p>
                  <p>But to be yet further encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and with a more powerfull motiue to be patient in the greateſt contempt; you may pleaſe but to caſt the eyes of your conſideration vpon the whole life of our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Redeemer IESVS-CHRIST, and there you shall finde, that from his birth in the manger, vntill
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:172208:153"/>his death vpon the reproachfull Croſſe, he was in a continuall ſtate of abiection, there ſuffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and diſdaine: <hi>Yea ioy being propoſed vnto him, he ſuſtayned the Croſſe, contemning confuſion. Heb.</hi> 12 and the kingly Prophet tells vs that; <hi>he was a reproach of Men, and the verie outcaſt of the people pſ.</hi> 21. <hi>he was diſpiſed and the moſt abiect of men;</hi> ſaith Eſa. 55.

                  <p>But you will ſay notwithſtanding, that contempt and ſcorne are pills of a verie rough operation. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny it: yet as their effect is exceeding profitable; ſo alſo their operation may be made both verie gentle and eaſie, by mixing them with a ſerious ponderation of the great folly in all wordly eſteeme,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:172208:153"/>and of the vaine praiſe and opinion of Men: calling but to minde how ſoone both he that prayſeth, and who is prayſed, and moſt flattered by him; as likewiſe who diſpraiſeth &amp; who is diſpraiſed, and diſpiſed shall be equally reduced to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible duſt; and how ſoone they are all to be preſented before that dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adfull Throne of God; where ſinfull malice shall be ſtruck ſtarke dumbe for euer, whilſt happie Patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce will be honoured, and rewarded for all Eternity. All which but well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, would free vs from the vſuall great repugnance which we haue to ſwallow downe the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned pills of ſcorne or iniury: yea it would enable vs verie much to ſuppreſſe our vnruly nature, and not to looke with an angry eye, nor to vſe any exaſperating words to them who haue diſpiſed vs, but to shew much rather all courteous ciuility, and in true Charity to pray for them.</p>

                  <head>How to moderate our griefe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the ſuddaine newſe of the death of ſome deare frend.</head>
                  <p>MOurning for the loſſe of frends is not to be blamed; nature being allowed to shew its ſenſe and feeling within the limits of Prudence and Reaſon in ſo iuſt a cauſe. Thus Abraham bewayled the death of Sara his beloued wyfe. Iacob deplored Ioſeph, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him as dead. The Iſraelits bewayled the death of Moyſes 30. dayes. This IESVS-CHRIST himſelfe approoned by his owne diuine example, ſighing and shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding teares for the death of Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus. By all which we may conclude that moderate mourning for the death of frends is not reprooued, it paſſing not due bounds, nor to the notorious preiudice of our life,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:172208:159"/>or health, which God and nature obleiges vs to preſerue; for the contrary would offend both God, and the ſoules of our departed frends; who euen in the paines of Purgatory are extreamely comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Gods bleſſed will, and diſpoſition; euen in thoſe their preſent ſufferings. It is therefore much more worthy of a Man, to let reaſon preuaile with him, for the cure of that, which tyme would effect to his greater harme: it being alſo moſt certaine, that as immoderate griefe doth but hurt to the liuing; ſo it doth no good at all to the dead; it much hurtes our ſelues, and is verie troubleſome to others. We muſt not lament (ſaith <hi>S.</hi> Paul) as the Gentils doe, who neither haue aſſured hope, as we, nor are comforted with the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an endleſſe Bliſſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he forbids not a moderate ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but only exceſſe, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds either from ſelfloue, or from

And therefore we muſt take heed (ſaith <hi>S.</hi> Cyprian) leaſt we giue occaſion for Pagans to think that all is but fables which Chriſtians beleeue of the other life; as in ſome ſort they might haue cauſe, by ſeeing vs ſo exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely to deplore thoſe; whom yet by death, we beleeue to haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned euerlaſting felicity.</p>

               <head>THE THIRD PART <hi>Of this fifth Rule: Shewing, what is required of vs, to comply with our obligation in obſeruing the Faſtes, and Feaſtes commanded by holy Church.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MY chiefe ayme &amp; intention in compoſing theſe Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Rules, being to propoſe to the vertuous ſoule ſuch points as are moſt requiſit for her practiſe in that great worke, and <hi>the onely thing neceſſary,</hi> I meane, of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her ſaluation: I could not omit to ſpeake of theſe two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, ſo mainely conducing to that bleſſed end. Faſting being the proper remedie againſt the great capitall vice of Gluttonie, that verie ſource of ſurfeiting, of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:172208:170"/>drunkeneſſe &amp; all kinde of beſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And by the rightly obſeruing the Sabboth, and other holy dayes the ſoule is nourished by vertuous practiſes, and getts ſtrength againſt all the fierce aſſaults of her ghoſtly enemies, when chiefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, vpon the other dayes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her temporall affaires and moſt ſubiect then to danger, and to the greateſt temptations.</p>
               <p>But now to treate of theſe two precepts in due order; faſting muſt haue the firſt place; it being a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and verie properly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth our ſoules to the right and profitable obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the other: this holy faſt and abſtinence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing euer been the generall prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of all Gods greateſt Saints, and as the maine expedient to diſpoſe their ſoules to heauenly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation; and to be made thereby more capable of Gods diuine gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and fauours; as will hereafter more particularly appeare by the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:172208:170"/>reaſons which mooued our care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mother the Cath. Church to inſtitute theſe faſting dayes vpon the eues, or vigills of all ſuch great ſolemne feaſtes, as are to be moſt deuoutly obſerued.</p>
               <p>And for the better comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what now is meant by this holy Faſt; you muſt here obſerue that there be three ſeuerll ſortes of Faſtes: the naturall; the eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall; and the ſpirituall, or meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall Faſt.</p>
               <p>The naturall faſt conſiſtes in the abſtinence from all guſtable things; be it meate, drinke, or anie phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call potion whatſoeuer, which can morally be conceiued to haue deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into the ſtomacke. And this faſt (for more reuerence ſake) is required for the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; from midnight before the day of receiuing it; vnleſſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſickneſſe, or ſome other iuſt occaſion permit the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſticall faſt is a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:172208:171"/>abſtinence from all flesh, and from egges, and whitmeate, according to the order of holy Church, or receiued cuſtome of the place, And as for the quantity; but one meale a day is allowed, with a collation at night of bread and fruit; and that alſo but ſo ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it may more properly ſerue for preuenting harme to our health, then for the nourishment of our body. And although drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king breaketh not this faſt (it chiefly ſeruing but to conuey, and diſtribute the nourishment of our meate to the ſeuerall partes of our body; and to refresh the blood) yet by exceſſe therein the ſinne of intemperance is frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>Faſting alſo, though properly it be an abſtayning from certaine corporall food (and that according to the order of the Church) yet by a Metaphor it is alſo vſed for true abſtinence from ſinne, which
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:172208:171"/>is the ſpirituall, or metaphoricall Faſt; and which the libertin ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our tyme, will haue only to obleige vs to be obſerued; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying the other, as ſuperſtitious, for beleeuing our ſelues obleiged to that heauie yoake of the law; from which (as they pretende) CHRIST, by the liberty of their new Goſpel, hath freely deliuered them.</p>
               <p>But this their bad pretence doth no more free them from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of obeying their lawfull Paſtors command of faſting; then it doth from obeying the iuſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of their temporall, and ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Prince: and therefore, as the pleading of ſuch a prerogatiue to the liberty of their Coſpel, would not exempt them from the due punishment of their rebellion againſt their temporall Lord; ſo neither doth it exempt them from being declared by IESVS-CHRIST, to be guilty of a farr greater crime,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:172208:172"/>and punishment for their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion to the command of his holy ſpouſe the Church; <hi>Math.</hi> 18. which being gouerned in all things by his owne holy Spirit; he will haue vs both to heare, &amp; to obey it, as himſelfe. <hi>Luke.</hi> 10. Yeawe shall not haue God for our father, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe wee haue the holy Church for our mother, as both S. Cyprian and S.

               <p>Firſt, that it be (according to the Apoſtle: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>reaſonable;</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Our faſt muſt be verie ſober and frugall; not riotous, nor with ſuch exceſſe of coſtly and dainty dishes, as that it may ſeeme to equall, or exceed our beſt furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sh't tables at other tymes: for that might be iuſtly eſteemed but an exchainging the former dainties of the land, for thoſe much more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly (perhaps) of the water; which truly is in effect but to delude; &amp; much rather to make a verie moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery of our faſt; then to comply
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:172208:173"/>with the holy end, and inſtitution thereof. And whereas we are adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by S.

And though we ſinne not by anie formall breach of the Faſt; yet we ſinne by breacking the Rule of Temperance, and offend God greately thereby, ſuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate full feeders, obſeruing but the outward forme of the faſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply not with the holy end thereof; which is (as the lentne Preface tells vs <hi>(to ſuppreſse vice, to eleuate the minde vnto Heauenly contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to obtayne thereby of God

                  <head>The ſingular great profit to our ſoule; by ioyning Prayer vnto volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Faſt, one day in each Month for our priuate deuotion, and by way of a ſpirituall Retreate.</head>
                  <p>THis is a deuotion practiſed by many vertuous perſons, to their great progreſſe in holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and therefore I moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly recommend it vnto you. For by thus ending the one Month in repentance for all your former offences; you may begin with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to amend them in the other. The laſt Saturday in each Month will be moſt conuenient for this deuotion, it being a day of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; and auoyds thereby both the trouble of dyet, as alſo of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.</p>
                  <p>You hauing made choyce of the day: the next is to reſolue to ſett all worldly buſines (for that tyme) aſide; and, ſo farr as your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition will permitt, you
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:172208:185"/>muſt be retyred from all companie and converſation, which may be occaſion to diſſipate and diſtract your minde from true heauenly thoughts: withdrawing your ſelfe by a true ſpirituall Retreate into the quieteſt place for your better vnion with God, and as to a happy ſolitude; there hart to hart alone, to treate with him all your corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and ſpirituall neceſſities. This is ſo great a grace, and ſo ſingular a mercy, which he moſt fauorably affords you; as had it been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to manie, who are now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out redemption in Hell, they would thereby haue made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues happy for all Eternity. Bleſſe therefore, and adore Gods infinit great goodneſſe to you, for ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a fauour: and reſolue firmely to make good vſe of it, by ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that day in thanks-giuing for his ſo innumerable great benefits of your Creation, and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for ſo manie powerfull
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:172208:185"/>meanes to bring you to that happy end of Bliſſe, for which he made you. And endeauouring to employ that day, as if it were to be your laſt: diſpoſe your ſelfe to a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration required to dye in the happy ſtate of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Conſecrate that day in honour of the holy retreates which IESVS-CHRIST ſo frequently vſed to make in prayer, and ſolitude with his heauenly Father: and let your comportment and conuerſation be, as in the diuine preſence of God: in imitation, and adoration alſo of that great modeſtie, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, ſilence and feruent prayer of our ſaid ſouueraigne Lord.</p>

Call to mind how faithfull you haue been herein; and what ſatisfaction you were able now to render him for all your thoughts, words, and deeds; what progreſſe you haue made in vertue, and what vnruly paſſions, or ſinfull habits you haue maiſtred; or rather haue you not been guilty, and much to blame, for the contrary, in them all? In fine you muſt make a verie carefull and diligent examen of Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; and eſpecially, wherein you
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:172208:187"/>haue moſt offended God that Month.

                  <p>If yet ſome (not acquainted with this deuotion) shall demand, for their further fatisfaction; wherefore this manner of ſpirituall Retreate is to be practiſed; I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were; that one but indifferently verſed in the holy practiſe of that other longer ſpirituall Exerciſe of eight, or tenn dayes ſpace, will verie eaſily perceiue the ineſtimable and heauenly treaſure, which is to be reaped by this the true abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other; and which contayneth in briefe, what the other doth much more amply, &amp; at large: and therefore it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to be wished, that all Chriſtians (who haue good lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and oportunity) would make vſe of ſo powerfully a conducing helpe to their owne eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:172208:194"/>workes doe ſanctifie the day, and makes it holy. Nor is one day more holy then an other, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſpent in more holy and pious employment: and therefore, as vertuous actions doe ſanctifie the day: ſo vicious, doe prophaine the ſame. And hence it is moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that God did not forbid the Artificer, or laboring man their honeſt, and induſtrious labour vpon the Sabboth day, that he should dance or ſport, and ſpend that day in ſloath, or ſinfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation: no doubtleſſe he forbid thoſe ſeruill workes (which are good in themſelues) to the end we might haue leaſure to employ the day in ſpirituall and holy Exerciſes for his glory, &amp; the greater good of our ſoules; by frequenting the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Sermons, ſpirituall lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and other deuout exerciſes of vertue. And yet if we examen but the practiſe of moſt mens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this ſinfull age; we shall
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:172208:194"/>find, that the chiefeſt difference which the Libertins now giue to the Sabboth, and other holy dayes aboue the reſt; conſiſts but in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cloathes, greater cheere, and much more idleneſſe, then vpon other dayes. So that, whereas the inſtitution of thoſe ſolemne feaſtes were firſt to purge our ſoules from ſinne, contracted by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular negotiations of the week e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes paſt; we much rather defile our ſelues, as ſwyne wallowing in the myre; to whom God ſpeakes by his Prophet <hi>Amoſ. c.</hi> 5. <hi>I haue with deteſtation reiected your ſolemnities:</hi> and truly with great cauſe; for to ſolemnize the holy dayes after ſo ſinfull a manner, is much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the ſenſuall Epicures, and the faithles Atheiſt, then true Chriſtian Catholiks: nor is God ſo heighly offended in anie other dayes of the weeke, as he is vpon theſe; wherein there is giuen ſo great occaſion of much more ſinne

                  <p>Nor doe I here intend to cry downe with the ouer-tyranous Preciſian Sectaries all honeſt and publike recreations vpon theſe dayes, in the afternoone (the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and Euen-ſong being done) No they hauing ſpent well the morning; and done alſo their after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons duty to God in the Church, he will be farr from taking offence at honeſt and innocent recreation; whereby poore ſeruants, and others, now dulled with the whole weekes worke; may then

                  <head>Of ſpirituall lecture; a proper Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe for all feſtiuall dayes.</head>
                  <p>SPirituall lecture is a holy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazen which doth furnish both our memory and vnderſtanding with pious thoughts for heauenly contemplation, whereby to vnite vs to God: it excites vs to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of vertue; and therefore, though it be daily neceſſary for the vertuous ſoule; yet principally to be practiſed thoſe dayes peculiarly dedicated to the diuine ſeruice of God, to whom we ſpeake by prayer, and by ſpirituall lecture God ſpeakes vnto vs. Which two holy Exerciſes haue great conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, and are mutually maine helpes each one to the other: and as meate and drinke are both need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nourishments to the body; ſo theſe are as neceſſary for the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Omit not therefore daily to giue your ſoule this neceſſary ſpirituall food, at ſuch tymes as you finde
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:172208:197"/>the beſt leaſure for it. Your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may be in the Imitation, or following of CHRIST; in the Saints liues; in ſome of Granada his workes; in the Introduction to a deuout life; in the Spirituall Combate; in the Holy court, or the like, But to performe your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall lecture with beſt profit, a good methode therein is verie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for which you may briefly obſerue as here followeth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, placing your ſelfe in Gods diuine preſence (as in prayer) raiſe louingly your hart to him, &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly craue his grace to make profit of what you are going to reade.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Reade leaſurely, and not as if you deſired to ſee quickly an end of the booke: but meeting with ſome good point for your inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; pauſe there, and conſider it with leaſure, and good attention, as if it were God himſelfe who should ſpeake thereby to you: which done, then goe on, and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:172208:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſtill practiſe the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Reade not for curioſity, but for deuotion, &amp; thereby to learne the true practiſe of vertue, and to inflame the will to embrace it; much rather, then to informe the vnderſtang what it is. Sticke not to reade the ſame booke (if it like you well) twice, or thrice ouer; for it is the leaſurely, and perfect diſgeſtion which breedeth the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt blood.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A quiet and repoſed minde is neceſſary for the reaping profit by reading: for as vnquiiet water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects ſuch broken and confuſed ſpecies of the shadow which is caſt vpon it, as one ſcarcely can perceiue anie true proportion thereof; ſo likewiſe it is the verie ſame with an vnquiet, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled minde with anie paſſion; which is vncapable then to make anie profitable conception (or but verie vnperfectly at the leaſt) with the beſt ſpirituall bookes; by
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:172208:198"/>reaſon that it being diſquiet in it ſelfe; it needs muſt reflect but broken and confuſed conceptions of what is reade.</p>
                  <p>Finally with a recollected and quiet mind, in reuerence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, let your reading be not ſo much by way of ſtudie to know; but rather in the ſpirit of true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to draw from thence ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall profit for the good of your ſoule: and faile not alſo to draw from your reading ſome good point in particular, which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite you to the holy practiſe of piety; ſtanding euer moſt careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon your gard againſt it's grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemie, that pernicious Sloath; which once getting roote in your hart, it will endanger the greateſt vertue in your ſoule. This dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vice of ſpirituall ſloath, and teadious vnwillingneſſe to all exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of vertue, I will endeauour to deſtroy by the enſuing article</p>

                  <head>Of ſpirituall Sloath, and Indenotion.</head>
                  <p>THis vice is properly a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing of the ſoule; a dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the mind, and an vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingneſſe of the will towards all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall deuotion, which declines vs from pious exerciſes, and makes vs negligent and vnwilling to the practiſe of vertue, it inclines vs to giue ouer our accuſtomed prayers; or at leaſt to performe them but verie negligently, and only by halues.</p>
                  <p>The great danger of this ſinne is ſufficiently declared by thoſe words of our bleſſed Sauiour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>the tree which beareth not good fruit shall be cut downe, and caſt into the fire;</hi> and it is neuer ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, as vpon theſe feſtiuall, and conſecrated dayes to Gods glory, and our owne ſoules grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt good. Againſt which Capitall vice &amp; ſource of ſo much ſinne; our ſoueraigne remedie muſt be to
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:172208:199"/>haue recourſe to God by frequent and earneſt prayer; that he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to enkindle in our harts the ardent flame of deuotion, and the true feruour of Pietie.</p>
                  <p>Obſerue punctually the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med tymes for your prayer, ſo farr as conueniency will permit. Quitt not your former vſuall holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, though they ſeeme neuer ſo barren and dry: yea though your fancy doth perſwade, that they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auaile you; yet be but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully patient with true humble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance, and God will at laſt not faile to beſtow both comfort, and his holy bleſſing vpon you.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo a great helpe againſt this ſpirituall Sloath, and indeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to reade the liues of Saints; and to conſider attentiuely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the great feruour and deuotion wherewith they ſerued God. And aboue all it might aboundantly ſuffice to cure our ſinfull ſloath, by conſidering the inceſſant, and
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:172208:199"/>moſt painfull labours, which IESVS-CHRIST, the eternall Sonne of God did take for our Example, and ſaluation; hee ſpending frequently whole nights in prayer to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father in our behalfe: what weariſome iourneis through ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Prouinces made he to inſtruct, and to cure the infirme, both in body &amp; ſoule. It may well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found vs alſo to conſider with what faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alacrity the Apoſtles made their continuall pilgrimage about the world to plant the holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel for the ſaluation of ſoules, and with what cheerefull conſtancy they gaue their liues for the glory of God. Finally by what other way haue ſo manie glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Confeſſors, and Virgins ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned their immortall crowne of Bliſſe; but by conqueringe ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſenſuality in the common combat againſt flesh and blood; whereby this dangerous enemie, (Spirituall ſloath, and indeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:172208:200"/>being ouercome, Gods holy will commands, and our corrupt nature is ſweetly ſubdued; and then takes pleaſure to obey.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto, hauing in firſt place propoſed Gods diuine Preſence, &amp; true purity of intention, as the two eyes whereby to direct all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their happie end: the next was; how we ought to regulate all our actions, from our riſing, vntill that we goe to bedd: after which I shewed how God was to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Prayer, by ſacrifice, and by the practiſe of other principall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and laſtly by the right obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of the Sabboth, &amp; other feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuall &amp; faſting dayes.

Yea Palladius recompts that one might haue beheld thoſe holy Fathers of the Deſert, by their only outward aſpect, to haue manifeſted aboundantly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward purity of their happy ſoules; and to haue enioyed vpon Earth farr greater felicity, then the whole world had been able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them; no melancholy heuing power to ceiſe vpon their harts, which were ſo truly vnited to God himſelfe.

By all which we now ſee that Saints haue not ſadd, nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, or penſiue counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; but ioyfull, cheerefull, and merry, as become their happy conſciences.

                  <p>And now that innocent harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les myrth, and gratefull alacrity, is nowayſe vnbeſeeming the ſame, neither examples, reaſon, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can be wanting to make manifeſt ſo apparent a truth: no for true pietie and right Chriſtian deuotion exclude not affability, nor doe they hinder fitt recreation or honeſt and innocent myrth, (wherein modeſty refraynes all vicious exceſſe) but much rather require the ſame; for a cheerefull alacrity, with a pleaſant modeſty, is moſt commendable; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently gaines much more vpon ſinners, for their amendment; then too ſeuere, or a rigidly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed conuerſation; which being ſo auſtere, would become vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; yea cauſe auerſion, and but diſcredit true deuotion and piety;

                  <p>Manie Saints haue been of this pleaſant humour and full of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and pleaſing ieſtes in their diſcourſe. S. Greg.

Manie Saints haue been of a pleaſant, and iocund hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and yet of interiour great vertue and perfection. Yea vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly (and euen experience makes it manifeſt) that a good word of deuotion being deliuered with a cheerefull countenance, and with an open &amp; frendly hart, it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates the ſoule, as doth a note of harmonious muſick, the eare; and takeing by that meanes a true poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the hart, it workes ſtrong

This is that holy intention which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes our recreation meritorious, as well as our Prayer; and which God by the mouth of his Royall Prophet hath ſo frequently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs; that we <hi>should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create our ſelues in him, with ioy: Pſal.</hi> 67. <hi>reioyce yee in our Lord; and be will grant you, your harts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.

                  <p>In danger of exceſſe, you may doe well to call to minde the bitter gall and vinagre giuen to our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour when he wanted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment, by reaſon of his great thirſt vpon the Croſſe, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the great and vertuous abſtinence of his chiefeſt Saints. Raiſe firmely your hart to God, and rectifie your intention in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; that thereby you may be the more able to ſerue him. Say with a holy Eiaculation from the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of your hart: O <hi>when shall I feed vpon the happy food of Angells in eternall Bliſſe; vpon that beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call viſion in companie of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:172208:219"/>Saints and Angells without end!</hi> And by this meanes you may feed ſpiritually your ſoule, as corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you doe your body; and your verie refection may be made thereby as pleaſing to God, as the ſaying your prayers.</p>
                  <p>Being now ſett downe at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with a sharp and hungry appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; make ſome little reflexion therevpon: as conſidering with how ſmall an appetite, or deſire, you vſually feed your ſoule by prayer, or by the practiſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; which notwithſtanding ought to be much more pleaſing to vs, then the daintieſt feaſt.</p>
                  <p>Let the memory of Gods diuine Preſence be a bridle to our vnruly appetite; lett it alſo refraine vs from all vnfitting, and detracting diſcourſes; for our corporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by this meanes may be made as profitable to the ſoule, as it is neceſſary for the body: it being taken by vs, not for pleaſure, and
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:172208:219"/>delight; but only as the remedy which naturall neceſſity requires at our hands.</p>
                  <p>Be not too curious, ſingular, or hard to be pleaſed in your dyet; ſince it little imports whether the ſenſuall, and greedy appetite be content, or no. Moreouer, what good ſigne can it be, that we truly loue God, and are willing to ſuffer for his ſake; if we cannot ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our ſelues, &amp; ſenſuality, in ſo ſmall a matter; as not to be able to endure ſome little vnpleaſing mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of meate; which alſo being ſpeedily to become ſo loathſome and foule an excrement, <hi>what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it</hi> (ſaith S.

<pb n="460" facs="tcp:172208:220"/>and thouart not content, nor gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teful to God for ſuch variety of good, and coſtly meate; which by the ſweate of other mens browes is ſo plentifully prepared for thy table?</hi> Take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to confound your ſelfe thereat; and command that ſome part of it may, (in ſatisfaction) be reſerued for the poore, and ſicke.</p>
                  <p>Call alſo to minde, that it is your mortall Enemie which you pamper: and therefore be verie wary that you make him not too ſtrong for you, by putting a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous weapon into his hand, whereby he may worke your deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction. He is now your ſlaue, but will ſoone become your Maiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if you pamper him too dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely. Sathan hauing ouerthrown man, and all his poſterity by this temptation of gluttonie, continues daily to aſſault vs with the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame battery: he knowing well, that if he can get vs once but to place our affection vpon this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:172208:220"/>of ſenſuall Ryot, he shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward verie eaſily diuert vs from all other chiefe occupations, which moſt concerne the health of our ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Make good reflexion, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well at your meale (eſpecially if at a feaſt) how manie pledges you haue there of Gods fatherly bounty, goodneſſe, and great loue to you: they being as manie as there be ſeuer all dishes of meate vpon the table: and how manie harmeleſſe creatures haue loſt their liues, that you might feed vpon them. O ſuffer not at ſuch a tyme ſo gracious and louing a Lord to be offended, either by ſcurrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, detraction, ſurfeits, or by anie kinde of prophaneneſſe. Call often to minde what will shortly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of that fraile flesh, which is now ſo daintely fed: when with Iob we shall ſay to corruption: <hi>thou art my Father, my mother, and Siſter to wormes. Iob.</hi> 17.</p>

                  <p>Finally to auoyde this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous exceſſe, by moderating the vicious ſenſuality of our vnruly appetite, whereby we are ſo greatly preiudiced; we muſt make ſerious, &amp; frequent reflections vpon Gods diuine preſence, which is a bridle both to our greedy appetite, and petulant tongue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67 Our ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting muſt be accompanied alſo with a pure intention of nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our body, to the end it may be enabled for the better ſeruice of God, by aſſiſting our ſoule in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing her actions of vertue: and aboue all; let our refection be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in honour and homage of the refection which IESVS CHRIST here vſed vpon Earth amongſt men; that by the infinitt merits thereof, ours may be ſo ſanctifi'd, as that we offend him not thereby: for by this meanes, and by a ſerious reflexion vpon the premiſſes, our corporall nourishment will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pleaſing to God, and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious

                  <p>You haue bard what conditions are required for a vertuous conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as alſo what fitting comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be obſerued by vs: aſwell at recreation in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, as at the table. It remaines that I alſo shew the defectiueneſſe of ſeuerall other parts of our Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; that by foreſeeing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their harme, we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the great preiudice which they vſually cauſe, both in body and ſoule. Of this ſort of vicious actions, (proceeding from an ill regulated Conuerſation) are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally theſe, whereof (as moſt harmefull) I intend briefely to ſpeake; to witt: Detraction, Rash-iudgment, Obloquie, Choler, Contention, Iearing, Mocking, prophane Myrth, vaine Singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vicious Loquacity, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the tongue. Of all which now here briefly in order. And to beginn with the firſt</p>

                  <head>Of Detraction, Rash-iudgment, and Obloquie, with aduertiſements and good motiues to auoyde them in our Conuerſation.</head>
                  <p>DEtraction, or Obloquieis, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſpeake ill of any perſon in his abſence, thereby diminishing his reputation, and the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which had been formerly conceiued of him, by thoſe to whome the detractor ſpeakes. This is an vſuall vice in Conuerſation; and more ſoules perish by it, then by any other ſinne. Granada thinks that halfe the world are damned for it; and S. Bernard ſaith that nothing adminiſters more matter to the fire of Hell, then Detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Manie are verie carefull to fly moſt part of other ſinnes, who yet make little ſcruple of this. Moſt are too forward to ſay what they heare, or ſee; and others are as content to giue both willing
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:172208:222"/>care; and conntenance therevnto; but <hi>as the Detractor carrieth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in his mouth</hi> (ſaith <hi>S.</hi> Bernard) ſo he who harkneth to it, <hi>carrie's him in his eare.</hi> Few rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this ſinne, or conceiue due ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for it, whereby to gaine their pardon of God; and fewer make due ſatifaction to their neighbour for the wrong, by repayring it. This made wiſe Salomon to cry out: <hi>who will giue a garde to my mouth, and a ſure ſeale to my lippes, that I fall not by them, and my ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue deſtroy me. Eccl.</hi> 22. for the tongue of a murmurer is worſe then Hell, which only hurteth the wicked, and thoſe who deſerue it: but the tongue of a murmurer hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth both the good and bad; yea moſt ſpite it hath againſt the good and vertuous.</p>
                  <p>The enormity of this ſinne is knowne by the greatneſſe of the harme which it procures to our
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:172208:223"/>Neighbour; and the good whereof it depriues vs, is the meaſure of that harme: Now it is declared by the holy Ghoſt, that the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and good-name, where of the detractor bereaues vs, ſurpaſſeth all worldly treaſure; and therefore he commands vs carefully to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it; <hi>haue care of a good name; for this shall be more permanent to thee, then a thouſand treaſures, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and great. Eccleſ.</hi> 41. And therefore to preiudice the good name, and reputation of our neighbour is a farr greater wrong, then to take away his life, or goods, and conſequently, as we would not be accompted theeues, or murtherers; ſo we ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to auoyde this da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; whereby we become both the one, &amp; the other in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; by robbing our neighbour of his good-name (which ſurpaſſeth all worldly wealth) and by a double
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:172208:223"/>murther committed with one, and and the ſelf ſame act of detraction; for thereby we both ſpiritually kill our owne ſoule, and deſtroy the morall life alſo of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours reputation, which is ſo verie deare to him. And therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtitution of this honour, ſo vniuſtly preiudiced by detraction, neither abſolution, nor ſaluation can be expected: and how hard a ſoare that is to heale, which is made by detraction; is experienced by any, who haue but endeauored to make that difficult cure, in repairing ſo great a wrong. And moreouer it is a great iniuſtice, and breach of charity, rashly to accompt a man vicious for his former vice: for he may be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and haue obtayned grace. Holy Magdalen had been a great ſinner, and long continued in that vnhappy ſtate; but yet shee was become Chiiſt's fauorit, when the rash Pharifie proclaymed her to be

                  <p>By all which we are ſufficiently admonished to take heed of rash iudgment; and verie carefully to abſtayne from detracting cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res; for Mans will often changes and as of a great Saint, one may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as great a ſinner; ſo alſo the contrary may fall out. Moreouer the great iniuſtice of rash-iudgment is verie manifeſt; for, <hi>who art thou</hi> (ſaith S.

And it is here well to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that though the ill reports of an other may be true, yet if the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne be ſecret, and vnknowne; it would be great detraction to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it to them who know it not; for although the ſecret cryme haue wounded the ſinners ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, yet it hath not depriued him of his good name, and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the opinion of Men.</p>
                  <p>It would be therefore much more Charity, and to farr better purpoſe, by due fraternall correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (when ocaſion requires it) to acquaint the offender in the ſpirit of lenity with his fault; and not by detraction in abſence, to hurt greatly both himſelfe and his neighbour; and yet to cauſe no amendment thereby at all.</p>
                  <pb n="470" facs="tcp:172208:225"/>
                  <p>Be verie carefull alſo to permit no blaming diſcourſes of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom you leaſt affect, or who haue aniewaiſe diſobleiged you; for detraction will there eaſily ſlipp in; whilſt others by flattery ſpeake ill of them; and you as contented to giue eare therevnto. In ſuch occaſions endeauour to turne by that diſcourſe the beſt you can; conſidering that if for ſuch little faults thoſe perſons are ſo much to be blamed; what then might we our ſelues deſerue, if all the great crymes, whereof God ſees vs guilty, were lay'd open to Men. Let vs eleuate interiorly our harts, and craue humbly his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine grace for the amendment of our owne great faults; which being ſo verie manie, we haue ſmall cauſe to buſie our ſelues in looking after thoſe of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: and yet quite to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, none vſually doe looke more narrowly into other Mens faults

Be therefore verie ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull to auoyde all detraction in your owne diſcourſe, and diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeauour to preuent it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: at leaſt ſeeme not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereat; or retyre your ſelfe diſcreetly, and with the leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence you can from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</p>

                  <p>THe next neare adioyning vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious branch to Detraction, &amp; Rash-iudgment, is Ieering, and vnciuill diſcourſe; which being ſo common, and verie hurtfull to all humane Conuerſation, I will endeauour briefly to giue you here a character of this vice; whereby beholding it's ſinfull deformity, you may the more be mooued to deteſt the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And for the better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereof; it is to be obſerued that there be two ſorts of euill Ieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

The firſt are ſuch as mocke and ſcoffe at holy things, and make but a ieaſt of our Faith, or Religion; of Sacraments, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and preaching &amp;c.: yea they prophanely ſport, and make myrth with the ſacred Scripture it ſelfe.

The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is not ſo black, as they paint him, Heauen is great, there will be place enough for vs all.</hi> Theſe and ſuch-like ſacrilegious ſcoffs, and mocks are moſt odious to God (ſaith the holy prouerb, c. 1.) and his manie dreadfull punishments, as likewiſe his angry and moſt fearefull threates to deride them alſo at the doubtfull houre of their death, ought to be a ſufficient
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:172208:227"/>warning for their ſpeedy amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as may be ſeene in this ſadd example (well deſeruing a flood of bitter teares) related by Doctor Sanders in his Schiſme of England concerning K. Henry the eight; where he attributes the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſtruction of Catholike Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (as a maine cauſe, amongſt the reſt) to thoſe prophane, and ſacrilegious ſcoffings, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous ieaſts of Syr Francis Bryan, the Kings boſome frend, and of the Bullins race; who thus in nature of a pleaſant ſcoffing ieaſter, laboured to pleaſe the Kings licentious and luxurious humour, by pernicious ſcoffs, and ieares at all things which were ſacred in the Church. One amongſt manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (not the leaſt for impiety) was this; when being demanded by the wanton King, what manner of ſinne it was, to lye with the daughter, after he had abuſed the mother? <hi>it was iuſt the ſame</hi> (quoth

                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe ſacrilegious and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ieeres he ſo fedd the Kings vicious humour, as he alſo freed his libidinous, and ſinfull mind from all remorſe; ſo that by little and little, his voluptuous hart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came voyde of all ſcruple for his moſt horrid ſacriledges; which though this irreligious Sycophant, by his deriding ſcoffs, had made now to ſeeme ridiculous to the King; yet we haue felt their ſadd effects, and haue had leaſure abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſixcore yeares to deplore them; and the vnfortunate King much
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:172208:228"/>more; who being come vnto the verie point of his vnhappy death; he called for a cupp of white wyne; and as taking his laſt farewell of that his moſt impious fauorit; he dolefully pronounced thoſe diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring words: <hi>O Bryan all is loſt!</hi> and ſo immediately dyed: leauing thereby for our inſtruction a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient warning againſt ſcoffing, and all manner of ieſting at holy things.</p>
                  <p>The other ſort of euill ieſters, are ſuch as ſcoffe and Ieere at the defects of other Men; as did thoſe vngracious children at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Elizeus for his bald head; whom God preſently reuenged by wylde beares, who deuoured them euery one. 4. <hi>Kings.</hi> 2.

                  <p>Others much more ſinfully mocke at deuotion and vertue: cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:172208:229"/>Piety, Hipocriſy, Patience, Simplicity &amp; Cowardlineſſe, a good Confcience, they call Scrupuloſity.

                  <p>This Paſſion of Anger, is a vice which the verie light of nature in Pagans hath taught vs to hate, and eſchew: for it was moſt truly ſaid by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Auguſtin) nor conceiue his owne anger vniuſt.</p>
                  <p>A good meanes to auoyde the great harme of this vnruly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious paſſion, is, to conſider that it hath fowre ſeuerall ſtations, wherein it principally appeareth in Man: in the hart, in the face; in the tongue, and in our deeds. If now we perceiue it to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gott poſſeſſion in the firſt; we muſt vſe all ſpeedy diligence to
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:172208:241"/>hinder that it enter not into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: but if it haue likewiſe gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned entrance there; then let vs at leaſt endeauour, all we can to keepe ſtrong hould and fortify our tongue againſt it; which if it's ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traging force, and fury shall in like manner conquour, yet let vs labour with all poſſible and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſiſtance to preuent the fourth, to the end that by no meanes this brutall, and ourregious paſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in deeds, and in actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, which God reſerues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to himſelfe, and moſt expreſly forbids vs to be vſurpers of that his moſt ſoueraigne right. <hi>Rom.</hi> 41.</p>
                  <p>An other good motiue to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe this cholericke and angry humour, when anie offends vs, will be, to conſider ſeriouſly with our ſelues, how often, and how greeuouſly we offend our Lord, and louing Redeemer: who in ſteed of she wing anger or reuenge, he continually powres downe
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:172208:241"/>his guifts, and great benefits vpon vs: drawing vs thereby to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to loue him, that ſo we may be capable of his eternall glory.</p>
                  <p>Conſider this, and confound your ſelfe, if anie paſſion of vnruly Choler shall tranſport you to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience againſt your ſeruant, or anie other perſon for ſome ſmall offence. Remember how great an ingratitude it would be towards God, to vſe with ſo little reſpect, thoſe his creatures, which both in nature, and in the end for which they were made, are equall with your ſelfe: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not withſtanding he hath ſubiected to doe you ſeruice though he might as well haue pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced you in a farr meaner condition, then they are. Reflect alſo vpon your ſelfe, and vpon your owne infirmities, and whither, if in their place, you should not haue been likely to haue done much worſe then they, with whom you are ſo
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:172208:242"/>angry, and diſconrent.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo verie worthy of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; that to be cholericke and full of Paſſion, is no ſigne of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous courage, but rather of great weakeneſſe, and want of true magnanimity of hart: for it is plaine by experience, that ſicke, and aged people are moſt ſubiect (through the great dobility of their ſpirit) to peeuish Choler and Paſſion, whereas true courage, &amp; a generous hart conquereth, and ſubiecteth them to reaſon, and to the law of God.</p>
                  <p>Finally a man of a milde, ſweet, and gentle conuerſation, is both honoured, and ſerued with much loue by all: but the chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike and peeui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To this ſinfull exceſſe in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, is alſo frequently adioyned an affected vanity, no leſſe ſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of pride; and as worthely to be condemned as the former, in all ſuch as by painting, and black-patching, would endeauour to chainge; or at leaſt to better the proper handy-worke of God: and yet should that diuine workeman

                  <p>I conclude this diſcourſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning likewiſe all inordenate affectation to vaine ſingularity, both in behaueour, and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions; it being a vice no leſſe vngratefull then the reſt, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes yet to relish rather more of the aforeſaid vanity, and deſire of eſteeme; whilſt we ſo apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtriue to doe more then doth well beſeeme vs; either by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting, to excell all others; or by imitating an other perſon out of ſome vaine end, and flattery; like

                  <p>In fine vanity is the ground of both theſe errours in Conuerſation,

                  <p>Much more might be yet ſaid of our Conuerſation, concerning both morality, and vertue, which I rather remit to the prudent refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions of a vertuous ſoule vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currant occaſions: recommending only to her, that shee keepe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall fixt eye in all her chiefeſt actions vpon the two former ſo frequently mentioned good guides which are beſt able to regulate them, and to render her Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation moſt gratefull to God: to witt, <hi>Purity of intention,</hi> and <hi>the memory of Gods diuine Preſence.</hi> Theſe two are moſt ſoueraigne Antidots againſt all kinde of ſinne; and haue power to make euen our meaneſt actions meritorious of a

                  <p>PRudence is a directing vertue to all our actions; and is no leſſe needfull to them, then is the ſteerne to a shipp: yea it giues them their right courſe, as doth a by as to the bowle, to bring it to the marke. This great vertue of Diſcretion is ſo generally neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as that all other vertues what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, require to be ſeaſoned with it; yea, and without which, euen the beſt of them would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come blameable and degenerate into vice; as S. Greg. and S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard doe both affirme. This is the toarch which giues light to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of our vnderſtanding, to the end it decline not from the right path of a iuſt moderation. It is the vertue moſt proper to Man;
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:172208:249"/>and to be deſtitute thereof, is to fall into the rancke of fooles, and to be eſteemed vncapable of anie worthy employment, or office amongſt Men: for who are deſtitute of Diſcretion, reſemble but meere brute &amp; ſauage creatures; ſince by reaſon only we are diſtinguished from them: and by Diſcretion (which is the operation thereof) we are knowne to be rationall Men.</p>
                  <p>The nature of this vertue conſiſts in keeping a watchfull eye ouer all our actions; and ſo rightly to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them by true Chriſtian Iuſtice as to fly ſinne, and to practiſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in all we doe: for Gods glory, and Beatitude being our laſt and only end; true Prudence requires, that deliberately we doe no vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary act which may be contrary therevnto.</p>
                  <p>That great Maiſter of Morality, wiſe Seneca, giues vs this prudent Maxime for our Conuerſation:
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:172208:250"/>that we conuerſe with frends, as if one day they were to be our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And with our Enemies, as if they were aſſuredly to prooue our louing Frends: for Mans mind is vnconſtant (ſaith Iob. c. 14.) and what it hates to day, it may loue to morrow: and therefore, as in our diſaffection we muſt be very wary, neither to ſay, or doe, what vpon future frendship might cauſe vs confuſion: ſo likewiſe we muſt be as prudently circumſpect in our loue, and forbeare to communicate in tyme of frendship, what by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſaffection might cauſe vs to repent. In fine true Prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that we ſo conuerſe with all, as that we auoyde the danger of all reproach, and confuſion from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frend or foe: for this is a heigh point of true Prudence in ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted an Age, and wherein frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is ſo fickle, and verie hard to be found amongſt all ſorts of men.</p>

<pb n="521" facs="tcp:172208:250"/>Chriſtian Prudence for a vertuous Conuerſation might her be inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but breuity obleidges me to conclude them in this one, for all the reſt: that our Conuerſation euer tend with a pure Intention to the glory of God, to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our neighbour, and to the profit of our owne ſoules; <hi>in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuerſation, and Godlineſſe</hi> (ſaith S.

               <p>This was the practiſe of holy S.
